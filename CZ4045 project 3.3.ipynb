      "Wish there was one of these closer to Gastonia/Kings Mountain!\n",
      "This is my favorite dog bar in the area! I miss living closer to it. The staff is super nice, and atmosphere is very laid back. My dog has a blast here. It's wonderful!\n",
      "Great concept in a great location, that being said there is a ton of room for improvement, the fence isn't very tall and there are a lot of areas that there is a bench pushed up to the fence making it very easy for any dog to escape. \n",
      "They allow any dog in no questions asked. \n",
      "The entire place is in desperate need of a pressure wash and cleaning. \n",
      "They charge for a pint of beer but it's in a 12oz plastic cup, that's 1/3rd short of a pint. \n",
      "The bartenders, for the most part, are huge dog lovers (and good looking). \n",
      "No place will ever be perfect for everyone but with some attention to detail most of the negative reviews could be corrected with very little effort.\n",
      "Just moved to NoDa this week and decided to try out The Dog Bar. Parked in the parking lot for the dog bar and bar next door. The entire parking lot was a mess and people were parked behind cars not in spots. I parked next to a dozen other cars (of note, there were no marked \"spots\") all of which were facing the train tracks and not blocking anyone. There were no international towing signs. \n",
      "\n",
      "We went in and instantly smelled the dog urine stuck in the plastic astroturf (terrible idea for an area exposed to rain and dog urine). It was fine overall. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we left, my car was no longer there... we looked around in the parking lot and finally found an obscure sign with words that said you must be a dog bar or blind pig bar customer... which we were so we were still confused. There was still no international towing sign/symbol. We called the towing company and they said our car was \"too close to the track\" which is ironic because there was no sign saying anything about being towed or about the train tracks and the distance you needed to be. We went into the bar and told the bartender, she said \"oh no! Yeah you can't see any spots they just come in and tow everyone, that sucks\". The cars that were illegally parked behind people and not in \"spots\" were not towed because I recognized the same cars backed up behind one another not in spots.) I am very frustrated with The Dog Bars response as well, if they often tow people for being too close to the tracks there should absolutely be a sign a few areas has a cement block but much of the area where people were parking did not. We were not closer than other cars to the track. Again, there would need to be an international tow sign. \n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, even though we relocated to NoDa we will be driving the extra 15 minutes to Lucky Dog Bark & Brew, where they have clearly marked parking spots and they don't tow. On top of that the facility is amazing and doesn't have old soiled AstroTurf. I highly recommend skipping this place for not only the parking inconvenience since they tow for unclear reason but also the place is a dump. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also the tow fee was $200, ridiculous. I'll never return and will make sure to warn people about this place. Not worth it.\n",
      "This is literally my favorite place on earth. I started brining Rocky when I first got him a year ago. I try to bring my pup at least 2-3 time a week. The owner and staff are so so friendly and I love the small atmosphere. Though they don't sell food, there are so many restaurants around you can grab a bite and bring it back. The parking isn't the best but honestly I don't mind it one bit. I trust this place more than the dog park.\n",
      "Hilarious.  It's like you're drinking in a live action youtube video.\n",
      "The name says it all... It's a bar that you can bring your dogs to. Husband and I had a pet friendly Airbnb we were staying at so our 2 pups came with us on the trip. I had heard about the ppave, but didn't realize it was around the corner. A late night in, we came here to grab a drink with pups.\n",

      "It's like a dog park with alcohol served! The best of both worlds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Good.\n",
      "What I just said above. Also, there's a decent beer selection to choose from. There's plenty of spots to chill at. It has an indoor/outdoor area and there's a covered patio with heaters. There's also a playground area and place to play some giant Jenga.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bad.\n",
      "It's not necessarily bad, but there was the smell of dog pee out in the patio area. It's what you'd expect  being in zone full of dogs, but a human wouldn't mind for it to be cleaner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's definitely an experience and if you don't have a dog, but want one... This is the place to get your fix!\n",
      "Ruf....Ruf...........if I was a dog my tail would be wagging for Dog Bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do so love this place and for the 40 minutes or so my GF and I hung out here we just loved watching all the doggie drama running around.\n",

      "\n",
      "The best thing about this place.........and the worst, was we checked in via the Yelp App on our phones, but only after we walked out the gate...only to find we got a \"Free Drink\" reward on our phones....so we'll be back!\n",
      "BEST PLACE ON EARTH.  \n",

      "We saw this bar while we were walking around exploring the cool neighborhood of NODA. We decided to check it out even though we didn't have our puppy with us. It was so fun. We had so much fun sitting in the big chairs on the outdoor patio, playing with the dogs that put a big smile on our face. Of course, the bar smells like a place would with 20 dogs running around, but owners are really great about cleaning up after their furbabies. Happy dogs, happy owners. Can't wait to go back, this time with my dog. She'll love it.\n",
      "Let the fur fly, y'all! I'm babysitting mans best friend and thought I would check out this place. Totes recommending to all my Charlotte bff's, like yesterday. \n",
      "\n",
      "The have pretty good parking, except during peak hours. If coming with fellow fur parents, car pool (and reduce that carbon footprint, too). Once here, please go into the bar area so you can admire the wonderful selection of local craft beers on tap. Then, head outside to monitor your fur child and socialize with the other fur parents. They have a few human games for you if like activities. \n",
      "\n",
      "You may see many fur parents taking selfies with your fur child. Casual. I know. Please feel free to partake in these selfie shenanigans with their dogs. Now, I gotta go because there is this really adorable boxer puppy and we're gonna take a selfie! See you hereeeeee.\n",
      "This seemed like a really fun idea..\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to see my sister and her family and I took my dog..so we went to Dog Bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well..i think if youre a regular, and know all the other people and dogs there that night, you will have fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one makes sure your dog has shots, theres pee puddles and poop is just sprayed away with a hose, possibly onto my feet..im not sure any employees were present, because other than the friendly bartender, no one is identified as staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were alot of large dogs that werent being watched by thier owners, who then thought it was funny that i was concerned about the well being of my small dog..maybe separate sections would be a good idea \n",
      "\n",
      "The place is really cute, and they have some fun merchandise as well..inside there are lots of cool pieces of dog artwork..beer prices were awesome\n",
      "The bartenders here are always friendly and have great drink suggestions. Steph and Adam are especially fantastic. It's a great place to let your dog run around and play while you hang out and drink. One of my favorite places in Charlotte!\n",
      "Sit. Drink. Stay. is the brilliant subtitle of this bar. This is a bar for people that love their dogs and enjoy a drink or two. People drink while their dogs play in a safe fenced in area. Whatever you do please close one gate before you open the next gate when entering and leaving the bar. The bar is located right on the street and this is a safety measure as long as customers use it correctly. If you're lucky you'll get to meet some of the regulars, two of the sweetest Great Danes ever, Skylar and Pierce. Totally one of my favorite bars ever.\n",
      "We love this place and have lucked out in that we live so close.   The main point of enjoyment for this place is being able to watch the dogs play and run around while you kick back a few drinks (which are much more reasonably priced than most of the bars in Charlotte).\n",
      "HMMM. Very Different and I LOVED its good for dogs good for people! Bar tenders are super friendly I love my dogs and they loved the DOG BAR. Great way to meet new people if your new in the area.... If your not a  dog lover don't go its that simple.\n",
      "I just love this place! I always go to the dog bar like every weekend with my dogs n friends. Adam and Stephanie have always provided us the best services!! My dogs got so comfy by hanging out there as well. The best thing is that you can bring your own food to eat there and drink your favorite drinks with affordable price while your dogs are playing with others. Who needs a doggie day care when you have this place to go? Love this place!!\n",
      "My dog, Thor, and I love The Dog Bar!\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you venture out this way though, you should know what you're getting into... Like other Yelpers reviewed, you must be a dog person.  The dogs will come up to you, sniff you, kiss you, and sometimes jump on you.  The first time we went out here, everyone seemed very on top of their dogs' behavior.  If one dog was causing too much trouble, the owner took them home.  Yesterday's experience was not so efficient.  There were a few dogs that blurred the lines between playing and fighting, and the owners did nothing except, \"Sparky, no.\"  I have problems with this, but the trouble making dogs didn't mess with Thor, so I just kept him occupied with other dogs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They don't do food here, but you can bring food into the bar.  Just prepare to have a lot of well behaved dogs showing off their tricks for a bite of your quesadilla. (Get your food from Cabo Fish Taco - nom nom nom).  I'll be back time and time again, but please - if your dog is not having fun, just take him home.  Don't make the other dogs (and owners) deal with him.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I were in town from San Diego and we're desperately missing our two pitty boys. We stumbled upon The Dog Bar after walking around in NoDa and we're so happy to see all the wagging tails! They serve beer in plastic cups and it's a great place to take your dog and have some drinks. All the dogs there got along great and we even made quick friends with the owner of a precious pit that was there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great place! Wish they had one in San Diego!\n",
      "I love this place.  Have limited time, feel guilty for not spending more time with my dog.  Guilt free drinking!\n",
      "This place is AMAZING! I couldn't love it more if I tried. The beer selection was great and the owner knew all 16 taps of craft beer by heart. He was extremely nice, welcoming and a good source of knowledge for things to do in the area. All of the dog owners were welcoming as well and the dogs were having just as good of a time as we were. I love that a place like this exists and here's another vote for him opening one up in New Jersey!\n",
      "This is a great place if you get off on rude service. Yeah, I love the dogs and their owners are pretty cool but the the gal that works the bar has the personality of wallpaper. The only thing this place has going is that they are the only game in town. If there were another, they'd clearly be the loser. Last night I was swindled for $20 when I was told I had to register my dogs (I have two). Oddly the place was crowded but I was the only one who had to pay the $20. The Dog Bar bites big time, even my dog had a poopy time.\n",
      "It's great to have a place like the dog bar in Charlotte, even if you don't have a dog!  They offer drink  specials & always participate in the NoDa Gallery Crawls.   There is a front Patio with bench seating for you & your dogs & an inside bar area with a Wii.  For 1st timers take your dogs on a Sunday when it's quiet & the drinks are cheap.  \n",
      "\n",
      "side note: Just make sure your dogs do not have problems with XL dogs like Great Danes, there are always at least 3 or more there.\n",
      "This is a great idea, but run by really cranky people and antagonistic patrons.  Like everyone is just pissed off and waiting to scold another dog owner.   I've gone a few times, and someone is always getting yelled at for some reason or another.  The dogs are happy, but the clients and wait staff are incredibly UNfriendly.\n",
      "As a non-dog owner, this place is fun. The bartender is nice, and it's a good place to hang out and relax on a nice sunny day. They offer several local craft beers and have good beer specials. Not being a beer drinker, I ordered a rum and diet, which was $5 using the house rum (still don't really know what that was), Bacardi would have been $7. After drinking that I noticed another woman drinking a Crispin in a can, (I would think a pint if I had to guess)... that was $4, so score one for that for those non-beer drinkers out there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like some other people who have commented, the conditions can become a bit unsanitary when you think about it too much, but that's why they don't serve food. The bartender is also in charge of cleaning up the poop. After I watched him fix my mixed drink I couldn't get past the fact that he also handled the cleaning up in other areas and stuck to the canned drinks. (Really had nothing to do with him and what I observed, just my mind running around with all of the things that could happen.) \n",
      "\n",
      "I think this was a nice change of pace for a Saturday afternoon and a lot of fun.\n",
      "Really great place! I love going there and I really wished people with small dogs visited it more often. My dog, who is 30lbs, is usually hiding because there's so many big dogs. But he loves it!! He will play with all the dogs and I have never had a problem there. It was my second time visiting and this time there was an overprotective dog who was bullying every other dog and the owner just stood there. I wish there was at least 2 bartenders on busy nights because one isn't enough. I know it was busy but I waited over 30mins just to checkout because she was so busy with people coming up to the bar. It's such an amazing bar and I love being around all the people and dogs. Its a must even if you don't own dogs!\n",
      "Dropped in here last night during the Noda/Yelp kick-off event.  Gotta say, I'm trying me best to not be a 'Nancy' here but seriously this just isn't my kind of place to hang.  Couple things stood out for me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, dogs off leashes.  Most were well behaved but some were a bit too playfull and the only thing that kept running through my mind is what kind of liability insurance do the Owners of this place carry?  If a dog bites someone mistakenly or not, I could easily sit a situation brew.  Oh well, that's for others to worry about I suppose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, maybe this was an isolated event, but lack of A/C in the bar area.  It was hot as hades in there even at 8:00pm at night.  Dog heat I suppose?\n",
      "\n",
      "Third and probably most bothersome for me is the pissing of the dogs happening all over the place.  Yes, it's artificial turf but something about being enclosed in 300-400 sqft with 14 dogs and 8 of which have taken turns pissing on the floor, etc. really turns me off.  Call me crazy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line, I love dogs, really, but there's a place for every(one) and thing.  I'm glad dog owners have a place to go if they want.  I just know that I'll probably avoid this place (at least until I get a dog :))\n",
      "I haven't had a dog in years (tear rolling down my cheek) but my GF does have a little dog, so I've been wanting a good reason to check out the Dog Bar in NoDa....I've traveled all over the world, but never seen a place like this...great idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place was well thought out to accommodate pooches of all sizes and the place is built so no manner of poop or pee pee would really do any damage or impact....kinda like \"kid proof\" but in  doggie type of manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have ever owned a dog...well owned isn't quite the right word, but I find those folks just nice and laid back....and people are engaging and it's an easy place to strike up conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beer and liquor is available and pricing is very reasonable, but I'd stay away from the Well liquor as I saw 2 times while I was sitting at the outside bar a big dog behind the bar licking the tops of the Well bottles then bolting off to hump some other doggy in the bar....So go with the canned beer just to be safe....unless you are into that kinda thing??? *grin*\n",
      "\n",
      "Was there doggy drama...of course....were the personality and looks of the dogs as unique as owners...absolutely?  Will I come here again....definitely?\n",
      "I really enjoyed Dog Bar, as did my precious angel, Maeby. She's very social and played with the other dogs at the bar while we socialized with the humans. They have a lot of local  brews and I love that  they let you bring in takeout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the other dog parents were a bit over protective (my dog is part border collie and is very vocal when she plays) & I wasn't a fan of them trying to discipline my dog for having a good time (I know, I'm a ridiculous parent... it's a good thing I don't have kids). \n",
      "\n",
      "My only reason for not giving Dog Bar five stars is thatt a) I don't like unisex bathrooms and b)they let two chihuahuas up on the bar, which seemed a bit icky to have dogs prancing around where the beer was served. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, it's a great place in a fun location -we'll be back soon!\n",
      "This could be may new favorite hang out. I have no idea why it has taken me so long to get to The Dog Bar- I've owned my pup for over a year and I always feel guilty leaving him for a night out. Now, I can bring my little guy out with me! You can bring your own food to The Dog Bar- we grabbed pizza slices from Revolution around the corner. Drinks were reasonably priced, there was a fire roaring in the fire pit and my friends and I brought our dogs- really what's not to love for a low key night out.\n",
      "Dog bar is amazing. Great drink specials and tons of PUPPIES!!!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a perfect place to let your dog tire themselves out while enjoying a delish adult beverage.\n",
      "Hey the Dog Bar is great! We had our sheepdogs out there for our daughter's sheep god's birthday party (yes these things are real!) The were a lot of dogs running around and ours got into the mix (and they loved the twin miniature bulldogs they met). We had a good time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only down side were some of the owners who wouldn't keep an eye on their dogs at all. There was one in particular, a born and white dog with an orange color that was running around growling and harassing the other dogs while the owner wasn't paying attention in the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll have a great time if you just keep an eye on your dogs and hope the other owners do as well.\n",
      "Go figure.  The night my husband and I brought our 5 pound yorkie and 12 pound weenie dog to the Dog Bar...there's a GREAT DANE meetup group. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the fact our doggies were intimidated to death, and didn't move around too much (would YOU move around and wag your tail if you were 5 pounds and the place was taken over by 160 pound GREAT DANES??) we wanted to like the Dog Bar.  It just didn't gel for us. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, we found it a bit unclean and the service was kind of, uh, not there. None of the dogs were asked if they had their rabies vaccines like they should be. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a great concept...simple b/c you can bring your own food, and it's a relaxed setting...but again, something about drinking around wet pee spots of gravel and poo didn't sit right with me.\n",
      "I really enjoy going to this bar to hang out with the variety of pooches it brings in. The prices on beers are usually very reasonable and the customers who bring in dogs are very friendly when it comes to letting you pet their dogs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside that kinda made me nervous is when some of the dogs decide they aren't liking each other very much. A couple minor frays broke out and even though they were quelled very fast by the owners it left me a little cautious of being caught in the middle of one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, another thing to note is that if you haven't been here in a while they have remodeled the place some and the bar is back against the far wall as you come in, it really opened up the space and looks much nicer and brighter than the old dark dankness it use to exude.\n",
      "I think this is such a great idea. A place where you can go to drink and bring your dogs and they can play with other dogs and you do not have to worry about them. \n",
      "But this place could be a lot better executed! I feel\n",
      "Like the owners don't really take care of the bar. It is pretty unsanitary rap with the dogs ON the bar! Also dogs pee in the water buckets and no one is paying attention to them to clean them out and other dogs are drinking from the water bucket that for peed in. \n",
      "The drinks are kind of expensive too and it's kind of gross that they give you cups on that bar with all the dogs on there.\n",
      "I do like that my dog can play there and I just wish they would pay attention more and clean it up.\n",
      "I love Dog Bar and would go insane without it. My puppy gets to run around and play while I have a drink or two. The people are awesome and all dog lovers.  They have heaters and without this place I wouldn't get through winter with my puppy.  They have good drink specials and great bartenders especially Jen.  I always leave happy with a tired pup.  My dog even knows what Dog Bar means.\n",
      "This place isnt that sanitary. There are only two dog bars i can find in charlotte, this one and the lucky dog bark bar and brewery. I think there used to be others but they closed down. Charlotte is a cool city to have dog bars, for that I definitely give it props. \n",
      "\n",
      "While this place has two bone shaped swimming pools, dog beds and games for adults to play, it isn't that clean. Dogs would pee on dog beds, pee anywhere on the floor mixed in with already wet grounds, then poop right at the entrance. The humans also are not that fast at cleaning up after their dogs. They have buckets of water for the dogs, for those are clean, but they aren't dog bowls, and a chihuahua knocked a bucket down just like that. They have one play structure here, and throughout the bar except for one section is green carpet. The bar inside is also very dark and not airy. There is only one bathroom stall, very small and unisex. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend lucky dog over this place, parking can also be complicated here as well, though they have their own lot, there aren't that many spots.\n",
      "This is the best bar in Charlotte. Friendly staff, great drinks, and tons of great dogs. I love bringing my dog Cooper here. Incredible atmosphere and the pups are playing freely.\n",
      "This is a great place to bring your dog if it's friendly or to just come and have a drink while enjoying the company of other people's dogs. It's a win win.\n",
      "I arrived at the parking lot for this dog bar at 11:45am with the intent of exploring the bars near Salud. My girlfriend has a Jack Russell / Chihuahua that I have contemplated bringing to this bar for awhile and I had the intent to stop by the bar to learn about the process for admitting your dog in person.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as my girlfriend and I got out of the car the owner pulled up and told us we had 15 minutes to get out of the lot or park in the adjacent parking garage in aggressive tone without asking a pre-qualifying question of, \"Are you parking to come to the dog bar?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been in the Charlotte area since 2010 and even after graduating from UNC-Charlotte since 2014 I have always viewed every local in NoDa from Abari to Cabo Fish Taco to Salud as part of a collective community that was warm and welcoming of all denizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "This experience has forced me to not even attempt to go through the process of introducing my girlfriend's dog Vixie to this community. If you are considering joining this bar make sure you do not park in this parking lot 15 minutes before opening because you are more likely to be told to move your car than you are to be asked if you are interested in learning about the bar and how to have a prospective puppy join.\n",
      "The place set up and decor is very minimal, but how many places you could go hang out with your friends and at the same time you don't have to leave your dogs at home.  There are plenty of sitting, dogs could run free, and you are allowed to bring your own food since they don't serve any.  This is not a place for you if you want to see and be seen, but this is a very good place if you just want to hang out with your friends along with your four-legged friends.\n",
      "Awesome little place that has beer on tap and allows dogs inside. What more is there to say?\n",
      "I have been frequenting this bar going on about three years now and have always enjoyed it.  I have never once been asked for any type of membership until recently i was asked to leave since i did not have one.  I was utterly confused and embarrassed. I have not once seen any dog with this elusive dog tag membership? Don't think i will be a regular here anymore which is unfortunate since it was walking distance from my home.\n",
      "Hands down the worst bar/dog experience of my life.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#1. It's Astroturf that is visibly wet from dog urine and feces, which is just watered down with a hose maybe once a day.  \n",
      "#2. Nobody checks vaccination records. Not even rabies, leading to a serious health risk. \n",
      "#3. There's not enough room for the dogs to run around, so it can sometimes turn into a hump fest with irresponsible owners that aren't paying attention\n",
      "#4. The staff is almost nonexistent.  They don't monitor or supervise, check dogs, or keep anything close to clean.  \n",
      "#5. There is a douchebag there that owns a 220+ English mastiff that is known to be aggressive toward puppies that aren't neutered yet, and yet will act like a Greek god and say its your fault.  Hope I don't run into him again.  \n",
      "#6. If you have an older, calm dog, and don't mind hanging out is a cesspool of dog piss, it may be alright.  But if that's not you, bring a beer to the dog park, or check out the Cornelius dog bar Bark and Brew.  Its a much better, cleaner spot with more room and better management.  \n",
      "#7. I will die before I go back to the NODA dog brothel.\n",
      "Dog Bar has been a favorite of mine for a bit but I have never been impressed enough to write a review until last night. After adopting in March I wanted to make sure I was able to get my pup out and about as much as possible. Dog Bar has been a perfect space for that. He is a 80lb ball of energy and loves other dogs so getting tired out at dog bar is a huge plus for me. They always have great local beers on tap, my dog has a great time and I have never had any issue. Last night I unfortunately did but I wanted to make sure I included it in my review because it only raised my opinion of the Dog Bar. Another dog was not taking too kindly to mine and kept coming up and being pretty aggressive towards him.I wasn't too worried because of my dog being very submissive and always backing down from those behaviors.  At one point while his owner was away there was a big greeting at the entrance of a dog coming in and in the scuffle my dogs ear got hurt. From my experience the MIA owner is not normal, I have always experienced people having a good eye and read on their pups. However it is still a bar filled with dogs and things can happen. I don't think you can go to any dog bar and be surprised when dogs are acting like dogs. This being my first injury since adopting I had no idea what to do and was in a bit of shock. Travis behind the bar was absolutely wonderful. He immediately gave me space to get cleaned up and calmed down. He brought out anything I might need and was so comforting and helpful. I hardly ever review places like I should but even after what could have been a horrible experience, the staff and fellow patrons were, as always, wonderful. This will not be our last adventure to the Dog Bar.\n",
      "The Dog Bar is a staple in our household. We love taking our Grayson there. The atmosphere is relaxing, and the amenities are exactly what you need, and nothing you don't. The dogs have free reign to play and bark and... well.. be dogs, and us humans can drink to our hearts' content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our favorite day to go is Sunday for the $5 \"big\" mimosa and bloody mary specials. No bloody Mary mix here! They spice them up themselves!  I also spent a good bit of time coming here on Wednesdays when my fiance was in night classes. It's a great way to break up the week for you and your pooch. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "They do not have a kitchen, but they welcome you to bring your own take out from anywhere. They even have menus behind the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here is great. Be nice to them and they'll be nice back. We love the Sarahs, but they're all great. \n",
      "\n",
      "When my parents came to visit from DC, the first thing they asked us was \"When are we going to The Dog Bar?!\" If that's not proof enough that we love this place, I don't know what is.\n",
      "You will definitely get a kick out of this place. Lots of fun and friendly staff. They also have a giant jenga block set,\n",
      "I wanted to visit more than once to write my review because this is such a cool idea. Unfortunately it misses the mark. The problem I think is in the choice of flooring. Astroturf is not as hygienic as they make you believe and I've seen several owners simply spray their pets poop with a hose, this only spreads around the feces. Everything below hip level has been peed on and there really is no hand sanitizer except for what you bring. The other problem is mixing alcohol with different types of owners. I see most all of the dogs, big and small, rambunctious and calm get along fine and do their thing but the people are a different story. I've seen near fights with over protective types and meh types. I think if this concept were really going to work, put a bar in a dog park not a dog park in a bar. Needs more space for everyone.\n",
      "Neighborhood friendly fun for you and your favorite dog pal.  Great for sporting events, even go alone and meet new friends.  The owner has recently done a new renovation, which opened up the inside and made the place a lot more people friendly.  GREAT drinks too and they don't mind if you order in or bring a picnic.\n",
      "Gawd - I wish my dog was canine friendly. But he's not. So, when I'm in NoDa and I want my puppy fix, I can just head to The Dog Bar and play with some pups. As you can probably tell, this is not a bar for every dog. If your pup is teeny and/or easily intimidated, it may not be the best fit...especially during a busy night. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Tonya said, if you're not a dog person, I wouldn't venture in here. The dogs are friendly and sociable...many of them have no qualms strutting up to you, asking for an ear scratch or a belly rub. Cuetness. So, it really is a dog heaven and haven - astroturf, plenty of bars, areas to sniff and play, etc. And the bar is pretty sweet too! Drinks are affordable, the owners friendly and the patrons cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though Riley (my dog) will never be a guest of The Dog Bar, I'm happy to go in his honor every once in a while to grab a beer and give some love to the neighborhood pooches!\n",
      "Dogs and alcohol!! Whoohoo!! Who wouldn't adore this idea?!  I love coming here and seeing all the dogs having fun and playing.  It's a very relaxed atmosphere...fun, carefree, and just al over cool.  It's surprisingly clean and neat...I guess depending on the day.  The dogs have special area to play in and there is an indoor and outdoor section for patrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff is friendly.  I really couldn't say anything bad about this place.  Whoever thought of it was a genius.  Good people, good drinks...best of all, dogs!!! Love it!\n",
      "It's the happiest place on earth! Screw Disney, come get a drink and hang out with a bunch of doggies! They do a lot of promoting for local dog adoption agencies as well. It's absolutely my favorite bar on planet earth.\n",
      "I'd never admit this to anyone but you, Internet.  Because I know you can keep a secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "I drink at the dog bar and never bring my own dog.  Instead, I sit drinking with my wife and loom over everyone else's pets.  I've twice considered grabbing the cutest ones and making a break for my car.  But then I'd risk spilling my beer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I simply can't imagine a more perfect mixture: beer and friendly dogs.  \n",
      "I honestly believe that if this place had better beer to offer than Budmiller domestic light lagers, I'd never go anywhere else.  But since they don't, it's usually a fun alternative after we get bored at another, lesser, more human-dominated bar in the NoDa vicinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, internet.  You have to check this place out.  Everyone loves dogs.  \n",
      "What?  \n",
      "You're a cat person?\n",
      "Oh...\n",
      "\n",
      "...stay away from me and my family.\n",
      "I've visited this place a few times before but will no longer be returning. The only reason I give one star is because there isn't an option for none! \n",
      "\n",
      "First, as many people have already stated, there are no requirements that must be met for dogs allowed in the place. Typically at daycares, etc dogs have to have all their shots and pass a temperament assessment. Here....that does not exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "And secondly, the reason I have NO desire whatsoever to return, is the staff. My credit card was charged for another persons tab...close to $100. Rather than discuss that with me in an apologetic way, I was handed a handful of cash with no explanation. Then my card had been run AGAIN for my purchase which was only ONE beer but it included a pitcher as well. I tried to get some explanations from the bartender and told her I did not order the pitcher. She nonchalantly told me that there were others with my name and got mixed up, but the pitcher was definitely asked to be put on my tab. So she would not take it off. \n",
      "\n",
      "So to sum things up, if you choose to visit this place....don't expect anything awesome and pay in cash so your card won't be charged by \"accident\" and for items that you don't order.\n",
      "As you would imagine this place really caters to dogs and does a great job at it.  If your dog likes to play with other dogs you have to bring them here.  It's like a playground for dogs with obstacles, slides, inside and out. The beer selection isn't bad at all, good enough to please the dog owners. for sure.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I borrow a friends dog I take them there every time.  This place makes me want to get a dog!\n",
      "\n",
      "***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***\n",
      "Great place! Super friendly bar tender - Travis. The dogs are off leash so interaction between them is great. Indoor/outdoor space with plenty of water for the dogs. Prices for drinks are fair. Its a bit smelly... But its a dog bar, to be expected.\n",
      "Awesome, awesome place!!!! These guys are passionate about dogs too. It's cool their dogs are always with them! You can grab food from any local restaurant and kick it (aka drink) while your dog gets out all that energy! Parking can be tricky as NoDa continues to grow. The staff is always pleasant and I can appreciate those amazing drink specials!!\n",
      "Nothing better than enjoying a pitcher beer special while my dogs get to run around and be social! Lots of delivery food options in the area with menus by the bar makes for an even better experience.... Just don't call domino's - they mess up your order every time. The staff and customers are friendly which keeps us coming back\n",
      "You know how when you walk in a bar, you can love it or hate it, in seconds.  Walking into the Dog Bar instantly loved it!  There are only a few bars that strangers talk to you, I love talking to everyone.  (Now there's a shocker.)  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are not a dog person, it might not be the place because the dogs do want to say hello.  It's kind of funny, you know they love going to play, dogs like dive bars too!  \n",
      "\n",
      "The patrons and staff are friendly and easy going, very diverse crowd, there is no cool factor, thus making it a very cool bar.   And the hot bartender is heavy handed too..  The Dog Bar makes me want to get a dog.\n",
      "Great place and really nice staff! The only problem is that the place is more for big dogs. Small breeds beware you will have to constantly watch your dog not to get stepped on by the bigger dogs. Maybe one day they will have an area for small dogs and I can relax and not worry about my dog .\n",
      "I finally made it out this place after hearing so much about it, and the rumors are true - this place is awesome.  My dog absolutely loved it.  It has a large patio with a lot of seating so you can sit back and hang out while your dog runs around and plays with other dogs.  The inside area is smaller, but still plenty of room if you rather sit indoors and keep your dog inside as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was suprised by the beer selection, they seemed to have a pretty good amount on tap.  Being that it was our first time, the owner was extremely nice and helpful and we filled out a form that took about a minute and paid a $10 fee (yearly).  They do not serve food but you can order food or bring it in and eat there.  I def will be doing that in the future since Noda has so many great restraunts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a huge fan of this place, my boyfriend was, my friend was and our dogs were!! Will def be back!\n",
      "Does your dog love to meet new people and make new furry friends? If so, tell me what that's like because I have one angry six pound Yorkie suffering from little man syndrome. He's the bully on the playground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, this bar is not made for my tiny terror... but it is still one of my favorite spots to grab a beer. A great place for dog owners and lovers. Enjoy a drink outside while the pooches run around and play. \n",
      "\n",
      "My group of friends actually ended up here one night on a birthday bar crawl. A roll-the-dice event and someone randomly picked The Dog Bar. Hands down the best stop of the night. The owners and staff were so friendly. The patrons all laid back. It was a really fun night... and none of us brought a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you've got a friendly dog or just enjoy dogs in general, this is the place for you. Warning to non-dog owners, one stop here may make you want to run to the Humane Society and adopt one immediately.\n",
      "If you have a playful pooch, why do you keep leaving him at home to go out with your friends, when you could be bringing him along? The recently renovated Dog Bar is the premier hangout for canines and their owners; and dog lovers without furry friends of their own can enjoy the scene and skip the poop-scooping. Great drink deals, many TVs for watching your favorite teams, and super friendly service. My little man is known by name and freaks out with excitement every time when he realizes our destination is The Dog Bar.\n",
      "The Dog Bar is a great concept & it always appears to be a happening place.  Unfortunately, my Milo is still \"intact\" & won't ever be able to partake in the fun here.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend & I came here on Saturday & they were having a St. Pawdy's Day party, which was a lot of fun.  Plenty of people were out hanging out & there were quite a few doggies.  What I like is that they're free to roam about the fenced in bar & they even had kids swimming pools set up for the doggies to get in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is very casual & not pretentious. I love the recent remodel they did, with adding a long, huge table out front & a nice awning-type roof out front.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind, parking there is extremely limited & even more so if the food trucks are there.\n",
      "Love this place. Such a happy atmosphere and great outdoor area. There's a good selection of beers/drinks and they always have drink specials. Plenty of seating area even when it gets super busy. Best of all, the pups always have a great tired and leave tired!\n",
      "There appear to be two types of reviews for the Dog Bar in Charlotte. There are the \"Woohoo! Finally a place for my dog and me!\" reviews and then there are the, \"Yeah it might be a nice idea but dog poo and pee and free roaming dogs acting up... Ewww...\" types of reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't criticize the latter reviews, because I'm the kind of germophobe who won't put her purse on the kitchen table, and I take my shoes off when I'm indoors because I think, \"Eww... think about where they've walked!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "All this to say that I GET the folks who are less-enamored of the Dog Bar than I might be, and I GET their reasons. But as a woman who wakes up with cats pawing my face (and freakishly realizes where those paws have probably BEEN) I am learning to let go on the germ thing. Which, you kind of need to do when you visit the Dog Bar.\n",

      "We took our dog Ella to the Dog Bar for the second time on St. Patrick's Day. The first time we took her was last year, when their patio was still gravel, she was still a puppy, and I was a Nervous Nellie about her bothering people or sitting her butt in a drinking bowl. I have loosened up in a year, and she's chilled out a bit. So on our second visit, we had a simply PERFECT time. We planned to spend an hour, but we spent about four instead, socializing with new friends, and enjoying the show as our dog made new friends of her own, both human and canine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dog Bar does not serve food, but on weekends and for special events, they often have food trucks in their parking lot, or you can get carryout from other restaurants in the area. We ate our food from the Maki Taco food truck on the patio tables at the Dog Bar. Yes, dogs had recently lounged on the bar, but our food was protected by a styrofoam barrier, and we took care not to lick the tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year they put down new protective astroturf at the Dog Bar which is permeable, and designed for dog use. Dogs peed and pooped on said astroturf, and it was kind of a \"One for all and all for one\" mentality as the nearest human would pick up the poop with a bag, and hoses were available to hose the rest down through the astroturf. JP took care to point out on the Dog Bar's Facebook page that this astroturf is specially designed for dog use, meaning it's porous and is sanitized each night. I wasn't sitting on the astroturf, so I was no more bothered by walking on cleaned areas where dogs had peed or pooped than I would be at home in my  yard. (Hint, this is why I take my shoes off when I get home anyway.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important reviewer of our experience at the Dog Bar can't type. Her name is Ella, and she had a blast. In fact, she's looking forward to us going again, likely this weekend. If you have a dog, or if you don't but you love dogs, the Dog Bar is a great place for them to hang out. I wish we had something closer to home in Ballantyne, but for now we'll trek to NoDa to give our dog a great day, and to enjoy meeting new people. The Dog Bar is one of Charlotte's most unique experiences, and I loved going and can't wait to go back!\n",
      "I have lived down the street from The Dog Bar for over 5 years but only ventured in this past Fall when my sister got a pup.  It is really great for not just the dogs but the humans too!  They have great beer on tap, prices are very reasonable, bartenders always friendly and there are cute dogs running around having a blast!\n",
      "\n",
      "When we bring the puppy here she is legit tired for the next 3 days, its a great way for her to socialize and us too.  99% of the people I have encountered here are great except you do sometimes get people who openly admit to not liking dogs and then get mad when one of them jumps on them, uh hello its a dog bar don't come in if you can't deal with that!!\n",
      "\n",
      "My only tiny complaint is that there are times when the bathroom smells like the dogs and maybe some cats have been using it, but other than that it is surprisingly clean and people are good about cleaning up after the dogs.  Overall though I really like it here and will continue to come down so the puppy can get her play time and I can get my drink time in!!\n",
      "It's a great place for your pup to have some off-leash fun with other dogs while you drink. But with that comes the inherent risk of a dog fight!\n",
      "Love this place... it's a great spot to socialize your dog and relax with a beer as they run around and play. Our dogs love going here and often play until they are completely exhausted. The bartender is a sweetheart and always greets us warmly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides drinks you can often chase your beer with a bite from the food trucks that are stationed right in the parking lot on the weekends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some clarification -- it seems to me that the people who have poorly reviewed this place don't understand the purpose of it. To be clear this is a bar with dogs (think dogpark with a bar).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not a Starbucks, it's not a workspace, it's not your local pub... if dogs aren't your thing or if you get uptight with dogs playing, running, and barking then this is not the place for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "However if you have a furry canine critter who wants to play and you like beer then it's a winning combo.  :)\n",
      "Considering the amount of 4 and 5 star reviews I am reading here, I would have thought that this was a good place to go for a couple of beers....Not so much. With that said, it has been a while since I just sidled up to a bar, sat down and drank a couple, so maybe things have changed drastically in regards to service, pricing and general  enjoyment of ones time.\n",

      "I had to drop off my youngen at his school dance downtown and had 2 hours to kill. I thought a drive over to NODA would be fun to see what's up and have couple of beers and wings while I worked over a menu I was writing for a Mardi Gras party. Parking in NODA is a bit of a problem when you don't know the area well so the open spot in front of the sign proclaiming that only patron's of the Dog Bar could park there or be booted (I am no fan of the BOOT!) I decided that, being a dog fan, I would get my saunter on and have a beer there with my 4 legged friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place if fairly dive-y (Me like-y) and there are dogs running all over the place. It's what I would expect. They have numerous beers on tap including local faves so I pulled up a stool and, though there was a big old spill in front of me, I figured the young lady tending bar would get that taken care of when I ordered. This is where I should have decided that a one and out would be my best bet. I ordered an OMB Copper which took a long time to get due to the changing of the keg halfway through the pour. She plopped the cup down and went to turn away, so I had to stop her to ask if she would be kind enough to wipe the bar down. (I had a notebook and my tablet at the ready to do some work) she gave a half-hearted swipe of the mess getting about half and then tossed a small stack of bev-naps on the bar near me, apparently so that I could do it myself. SUPER!\n",
      "\n",
      "The lovingly made Copper does wonders for one's soul and I happily ignored my disdain and worked on my menu. The bartender was a loud and boisterous soul (which I have no problem with as long as you are getting your work done). I finished my beer, during which time I found out that she was having decidedly too little sex with her not-a-real boyfriend,( just a FWB), watching her drop a case of beer on the floor and other fun stuff. She saw that my cup was empty and took care of the business of a fresh beer. That was pretty much the end of my personal service for the evening.  I finished the beer in about 20 minutes and placed my cup in front of me while I worked. She sat/stood about 4 feet away from me on the other side of the bar and told two guys all about her life, her website, all her hopes and dreams, about how cheap it is to have your Mani-Pedi done by Asians, etc, while my cup sat there in plain view. I even made eye contact and yet at that time she was not ready to finish her role as talking person and it sat. Then more people walked in (about 10) she walked by my empty cup and got to serving the crowd. At one point she served a couple of Jagerbombs and knocked a fat shot of Jager back herself while I sat there and watched. This operation took anther 10-15 minutes. At this point I had enough and just wanted to pay and roll. Finally she deigns to give me the time of day and asks if I need another. No says I and I hand her a $20 to pay my 2 cups of beer. $9.50 later (for a beer made down the street) and I am on my way. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the last 20 minutes of my stay, she lost sales for her employer, stole liquor, broke the law by drinking behind the bar, and lost a good tip. Not a good performance by a long shot.  I feel no need to ever go back and really rue the fact that I didn't take the time to get out faster and try another joint.\n",

      "The last time I went was the last. I was with a large group of friends and one overly aggressive dog kept peeing in the water the dogs drink from. The workers replaced it a couple times but then they they just gave up. The same dog continued to repeatedly pee in it. And the employees watched it and did nothing. They didn't replace the water and they did not ask the owner of the dog to leave or even identify the owner to get it to stop. Meanwhile the other dogs continued to drink from that dish. \n",

They always make me (and my dog) feel very welcome. They have a different drink special every night which is nice for us folks on a budget.\n",
      "\n",

Me and my fur ball are definitely new regulars!\n",

      "\n",
      "I have two dogs and I enjoy The Dog Bar, but I think a lot of the experience has to do with the dog owners.  It is positive when dogs are playful and cleaned up after.  It is negative when dogs feces are not cleaned up and dogs are too rough.  The staff at the dog bar are friendly and it is just a chill place-dog feces are cleaned up by the staff, but really if it is your dog it is your job to take care of it...\n",

      "They do NOT serve food here (sanitary reasons), but NoDA has so many food options there are not issues with finding something delicious.\n",
      "I live about a mile from The Dog Bar, and several years ago, when it was still rather new, my young neighbor and I went to check it out.  Our experience was not good at all.  We went in the afternoon and there were a few other people there.  They appeared to be \"regulars\" because they knew each other and the bar tender and seemed to engage in comfortable conversation.  I am in an older generation than most who would frequent this place, but my neighbor was in her late 20s at the time.  I mainly remember feeling rather snubbed, and even when we tried to engage others in conversations about their dogs, we were met with rather cold stares, and the affect was that we were unwelcome visitors.  The bottom line is we never went back.  Dogs are very important to me and they are my young neighbors very LIFE!  We had hoped to find a place to hang out with people of like mind and maybe form some friendships.  In my opinion, The Dog Bar is not the place for that!  It seemed more like a yuppy wannabe place to me!\n",
      "Looking for a fun place to party with your canine friends?! Grab your leash and drag your human down to the dog bar because this place is all about us: the dogs!\n",
      "\n",
      "Leave that string of restraint at the door and let loose your inner puppy that the humans won't let you do at home. (No running in the house Fido! Scratching up my bamboo floors...) But you can run here! Have a ball of a time with the regular pals and meet some new guys and gals too. Keep it clean - any bar fights and they'll boot you to the curb and tie you to a sign alone! (Same applies for the humans!) Go anywhere you like and literally \"go\" anywhere you like - the floors can handle it. (Sorry humans, this only applies to the dogs - it's a sign you've had one too many!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Water is around by the bucket! (Spirits by the bucket-load for humans!) Space caters to canines for wrestling matches, rope tug-o-war and some light fetch. But it might be a good idea to stay \"in bounds\" inside the fences. Watch out for the little humper - we all know he's trying to make up for his size with a little bit of a domination Napoleon complex. And be sure to give any human that dares to walk in here food-in-hand the group stare down because they just ought to know better! Teasing us dogs that way... Most of all just have a dog-on good ol' time because that keeps the humans hanging ten with beer in hand. (See it can be good fun for all!)\n",
      "Really cool concept, but seemed a bit unsanitary. I came there as a non-dog owner but one who loves dogs. There were a few dogs fighting that weren't really monitored which made me a bit nervous. I would go back because the beer selection was good (lots of good local beers) and I love dogs, but you must be okay with the concept to like this place!\n",
      "It's a bar dedicated to the dogs! Love the concept and the service from the bartenders. As someone who just moved to the area, I felt a little nervous my first time as everyone seemed to know everyone, but instantly was greeted by the bartender Deidra and I think she could tell I was new. On my next visit she remembered me, which made me feel really welcomed. Back in Florida, I was a regular at the dog park, so I'm glad I've found a place up here that my dog and I enjoy!\n",

      "First of all, I should mention, I am a huge dog lover & own my own pet care business so I am obviously not phased by dogs playing, barking, pottying, etc. As you can see from ratings, most of the poor ratings are from people who do not like seeing dogs potty nearby... do not go to the Dog Bar if you don't want to see dogs pee/poop. \n",

      "Other reviews mentioned being \"snubbed\" because they didn't have a dog along. I would still go to the dog bar if I didn't have a dog.

      "\n",
      "Based on 2011 reviews, they must have hired all new staff because I have been served by 3 different people at The Dog Bar and they were all wonderful! Their love for dogs was obvious and they are always so happy to be at work, meeting other dog lovers. Occasionally you have to speak up for a drink, but that makes sense to me... people politely sitting at the bar are harder to notice when there are tons of cute pups & friendly people around. \n",

      "We visited The Dog Bar on a Sunday afternoon just to ogle other people's puppies.  Such fun!  Although we didn't have any dogs, the staff appeared to be friendly and accommodating, and I was impressed at the availability of hoses (for obvious reasons), water bowls and decorative fire hydrants on the large patio.  The seating was pretty cool with what I can only describe as tall, two-seater Adirondack chairs around the patio perimeter, and some high top table and picnic style tables in the middle, on top of astro turf. Ha!  The beer selection was mostly local brews (OMB, NoDa, etc.) and came in plastic cups, so you're definitely not coming here for the brews, but the friendly dogs, patrons and staff are more than enough!\n",
      "I love this place. I love the concept, the bartenders, the beer list, the way they pour their drinks. That said, I have two boxer mixes, who, while not at all aggressive, play rough. They sometimes knock your little dog over. And the clientele kill this place. Most weeknights are fine, but Sundays are awful. The second your pit-looking dog is within 10 feet of a scuffle, the people their label it the instigator. I wish I could go here all the time, but most days it's just not worth the drama with a rambunctious dog.\n",

      "A bar where dogs can play with each other (inside, outside, behind the bar, on top of the bar...). There is a lot of outdoor space too with tons of seating and tables and a fire pit. Drinks arent necessarily cheap, but they have some good specials. Being they allow dogs inside, they dont serve food, or use glass (we don't want broken glass shards in puppies paws you know), but you can totally bring whatever take out food you want with you. Its normal to see pizzas, snacks, chinese food, you name it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love this place because my dog does. There is a huge variety of people that show up, from people just coming to play with dogs (there's usually more dogs than people) to the guy that brings his pack of five, young girls that have no clue what to do with their dogs training, the guy that im pretty sure just showed up to hit on girls with puppies, older citizens with their older companions. Everything. And usually, people will want to talk about dogs so if you're bored at home and your dog needs something to do, this is your place. I see lots of people just buy sodas too, so don't feel obligated to purchase booze to go to this bar. Oh, and bring some hand sanitizer or wet wipes with you. Stinkey dogs abound.\n",

      "If you are visiting (with or without a dog)- don't really plan on going anywhere nice after, your clothes could get doggy. While most dogs are well behaved, that one owner that doesn't pay attention/who fell behind on training/ who thinks its cute when muddy/drooly fido jumps all over you, will probably show up. All in all, most of the dogs are really great and the owners do well at training them. But one rambunctious untrained dog can really ruin the dynamic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips to people who would like to bring their dog:\n",
      "-Its a $10 year membership for each dog. Bring their rabies info with. The people with dogs not paying that day already have memberships, don't feel bad about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "-If your dog is not already trained to listen to you, its not going to magically happen here. People want to bring their dogs to be socialized, which is good, but they also miss the part that the dog needs to be under control (meeting a ton of new dogs is already exciting enough for your pooch). If you need to sit there and scream at your dog for it to stop and come back to you, your dog isn't ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "-The other dogs are usually medium to large sized. Usually small dogs would be fine, unless a bad owner brought their crazy dog in and its making all the others rambunctious. \n",
      "\n",
      "-When you arrive, there is a double fence. You can unleash your dog in the middle of the fences, then let them into the bar so they're not stuck on the leash when the pack of dogs crowds the gate to come greet the new people.\n",
      "TIP- try to come in quickly, before all the other dogs notice someone is at the fence. It will get really crowded near the gate, and youre more likely to get jumped on if you linger around.\n",
      "\n",
      "-The bar doesn't \"allow\" jumping or humping, so feel free to get the dogs paws off the bar if you don't want it near you, or please break up any humping that may happen, even if its not your dog. Also, its hard to always see your dog, so if another dog poops near you, it'd be swell if you could scooper it quick so others don't step in it. Scooping poop is better than cleaning it off your dog later!\n",

      "UPDATE 4/5/12: The previously dirty gravel patio has been upgraded to a wonderful turf system that is santitized daily (and now I can actually wear normal clothes here! The previous patio made everything, and everyone, filthy). Five stars!!\n",
      "So any place that allows my awesome, amazing, handsome dog gets 5 stars. However, my dog got very sick after going here so I have to subtract 2 stars. I do not fault the Dog Bar owners for the sickness, but if your dog is susceptible to getting sick easily I don't think it's a great place to take your dog. My vet yelled at me because you just can't predict how other people take care of their pets, so just be aware if your dog doesn't have a strong immune system. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, this place overall is just awesome. I love that you can take your pets and all the dogs seem to be super friendly. The beer is in plastic cups, but not too pricey. And they allow you to bring in pizza or any other food into the place since they don't serve any. \n",

      "So far so good. After reading the reviews I am a bit skeptical. There's a dog bar in Lake Norman where the staff picks up after the dogs so we don't have to worry about mess. From what I've read you just have to hope owners do it themselves which is ok  as long as they do. However, this place allows 18 years old and up where as the other only allowed 21 and up so that is awesome. I am excited to try this place out and hopefully write a good review later.\n",
      "If you have pets and want a beer then you must stop here. THe pets even sit next to you at the bar. This place was really cool and the bartender knows how to make some very tasting drinks. I had some salty pretzel drink did not taste like alcohol at all. I wonder what the\n",
      "Oh my gosh.  We came to watch a football game & actually watched the dogs.  At least 20 great dogs in here.  Limited beer choices and no food (because dogs) but fun atmosphere especially for dog owners with laid back canine kids.  Wish there was no smoking.  And clean bathroom.\n",

      "I love dog bars. I love hanging out with my dog while having a beer, and I love not feeling guilty about leaving said dog at home while having a beer, but I do not like constantly having to untangle my dog from her leash while tied to a table. Dog bar is the answer. The dogs run free, and have a great time so you can enjoy yourself as well. I also appreciate any bar I can show up in yoga pants to. Their beer selection is great. Not the cleanest place, and the smell isn't pleasant, but, dogs. Even if you don't bring your dog the entertainment factor of dogs running around playing with each other or laying on the bar is pretty great.\n",
      "Had a lot of fun visiting The Dog Bar. Love the concept and can't believe places like this don't exist everywhere! Very social place and I was happy to not see any issues break out between any of the dogs.\n",

      "Does not serve any food, but there are usually food trucks around, or you can pop into any of the other great restaurants in the area.\n",
      "Super fun! Looking for something to do while you drink? Come here and pet some dogs! Insider tip- bring your leftovers in a bag/box from where you just ate and the dogs will all be attracted to you and your wonderful smelling bag. Now if only I had a similar trick with the ladies...\n",
      "Are you one of those people that feels guilty every time they leave their pups at home?  Well I am I always feel bad when I yet again leave the house and my little pups sit at the window and wonder why they can't come with.  Well problem solved (as far as grabbing  beers and cocktails)  The Dog Bar in NoDa is the perfect place to relax outside with your pups grab a few drinks, hang out with friends, and hopefully meet some new human and canine friends.  At least you know when you come to the Dog Bar you already have something in common with the people that hang out there!\n",

      "I love the Dog Bar now I must admit my dogs can be a little neurotic so I needed to check the place out by myself before I actually brought them with me.  Its great that the dogs are free to roam around the bar, you may have a dog next to your feet, standing on the table beside you, begging for a sip of your tasty drink but they are all having a great time.  Looking forward to some nice weather and outings at the Dog Bar this spring and summer!\n",
      "We decided to give the Dog Bar a try last Saturday night.  Our dog Ross is 4, so we figured he was old enough to drink legally now.  We had a fun time watching Ross socialize with other dogs, as he never gets a chance to.  Yes, he tries to sniff the occasional butt while we're walking through the park, but it gets crazy there when you're trying to get some exercise.  Plus, at the dog bar, at least we can have a drink in our hands while Ross does his thing.  All of the dogs were so well-behaved, too.  We were amazed.  Maybe it's the beer they have in the dog bowls?  Kidding.\n",

Other than the adorable dogs, I can't  much about the atmosphere of the Dog Bar.  They could use a little more decor and sprucing up to make it even more dogcentric than the one fire hydrant.  Plus, the service was a bit lacking, the beer warm, and they were only accepting cash that night (who carries cash anymore?).  So it really is about the dogs and the company you bring with you.\n",
      "I like this small dog bar. It's in a very artsy part of town. It's all fenced in and dogs can even sit on the bar. I saw that and had to go! I picked this as destination for my birthday weekend. The locals were very friendly, service was good, and drinks were flowing. They have a kissing booth and pool for the dogs. I got the best photos and had so much fun with my husband and pup for my birthday.\n",
      "I went here twice already. The most recent visit was because of a doggie's 2nd birthday party., awesome place for it. If you have the love for dogs. This bar is like you died and went to heaven.. Dogs galore. And their owners are understanding and are aware of their dogs and their dogs surrounding.. and to top it off, your dog can run freely while you socialize and have a few drinks. I mean I can't complain. Just perfext!\n",
      "Dog + beer = cool idea.  But beer in plastic cups?!  Yuck.  Not a place I'd want to spend more than an hour, but a good place to come with your friends who have doggies with a need to socialize.\n"
