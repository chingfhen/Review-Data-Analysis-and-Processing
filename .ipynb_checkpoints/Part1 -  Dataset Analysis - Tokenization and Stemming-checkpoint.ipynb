       "[\"Food: 2.5/5\\nAtmosphere: 3.5/5\\nService: 3.5/5\\nOverall experience: 3/5\\n\\n(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)\\n\\nAfter seeing pictures my friends took of a monstrocity of a poutine i just had to check out Big Cheese. Once you walk in, a small walkway guides you to the front where a giant menu board hangs over an open kitchen. After placing your order you can wait in their small dining area which could probably hold 10-15 people. There is more room in their back patio if you decide to stay and eat.\\n\\nThere are two sizes, small or large with about $2 difference. There portions are fairly large so I suggest getting a small if you want to avoid food coma for the rest of the day. The prices range from $7 - $10 and a choice between traditional, pork, chicken or beef products on top of the poutine. We went on the weekend so our fries came out pretty fast. We didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes.\\n\\nMy bf ordered a small Traditional Poutine ($5.49 - Quebec cheese curds and poutine sauce) and I had the small Porky Pig ($7.99) with double smoked bacon, italian sausage, sauteed mushrooms and carmalized onions.\\n\\nThe fries were crispy, covered with a decent amount of dime sized curds, and then heavily drenched with a flavourless gravy. My Porky Pig poutine was overly salty and looked like a mess. Instead of layering the toppings and curds within the fries, they just plopped it on top of the fries without combining all the toppings together. \\n\\nOverall, the Big Cheese is nothing to get overly excited for. I enjoy the novelty of having a wide variety of poutines, but the overall poutine lacked flavour and flare. I definitely had better!\",\n",
       " 'Late night heavy snack! hahah.\\nHad the peppercorn steak poutine, good flavor with a bit of kick from the peppercorn.\\nPerson in front of my had the Notorious P.I.G. and it  looked soooo good! I will get that next time! :)\\n\\nMy fries were crispy, and cheese melty and the ratios were all good.',\n",
       " \"I agree with other reviews that the fries were under cooked and a little to firm. The gravy also did not have much flavour. For me the gravy either makes or breaks a poutine and this was a let-down. \\n\\nI purchased a large and it was very filling. I didn't finish the box but that may have also been partially due to the under cooked fries and lack of flavour in the gravy. \\n\\nI had the chipotle pulled pork (hog heaven) and the pork was delicious. I loved that pork. If I could get that chipotle pulled pork on a sandwich it would make for a great lunch. \\n\\nI may try it out again but I won't go out of my way to get this stuff. \\n\\nHopefully they can improve on the key ingredients to have a superior product.\\n\\nService was great and quite quick but it wasn't too busy.\",\n",
       " \"Before I went vegan I would always get poutine from here and it was soooo good. I decided to try the vegan poutine and was expecting it to be disappointing, but it was actually really good  even without real cheese (and it's awesome that they include vegan options). I had a slight problem with my order (I paid for extra ingredient and it was really lacking in what I ordered) but the owners went out of their way to make it up to me, so it's clear they care about customer satisfaction. If you want a poutine, go here! Definitely worth it.\",\n",
       " 'This was a huge disappointment. There\\'s nothing more satisfying than deep fried potatoes smothered in cheese and dark brown deliciousness, but I left the Big Cheese feeling like crap. It could have been because I ordered the vegetarian nacho poutine and not the traditional like I should have. Who came up with the bright idea to mix guacamole with beef gravy? In my defense, I didn\\'t know they were going to add the gravy to it. For some reason I was imagining it was going to be similar to The Works from New York Fries, but it was so far from it. This is probably the only time I would ever pick a food court meal over something more \"gourmet.\"\\n\\nDespite my gross poutine, I would give the Big Cheese another chance because there are probably better ones I could have chosen. The fries were decent, and the prices are on par for your average urban poutinerie. I find the menu to be overloaded with strangely elaborate toppings and I\\'m more of a simple creature. It\\'s your potato equivalent to Tubby Dog - you either love it all, or you can only handle so much of it.',\n",
       " \"This place was not what it was chocked up to be.  I went in Thursday afternoon with a friend.  I had heard good things, and wanted to try it out. I love poutine. \\n\\nThe cashier was so stoned she couldn't understand a word we said to her.  My bud tried to make conversation and she just stared blankly. Did not smile,  say hello,  goodbye,  or thanks for coming.  Less actual service than you'd get from the worst McDonalds restaurant. The cook in the back looked pretty ripped too. By the time we got the food I was already discouraged. \\n\\nThe poutine was mediocre,  nothing I would recommend you go out of your way for as we did. I just got a regular poutine.  My friend said his tortilla poutine or whatever was good,  but he's from Columbia and just didn't want to offend me I guess.\\n\\n0/10 cheese curds.  McDonalds makes better poutine.\",\n",
       " \"Giving it 4 because the toppings & fries were good. Don't go expecting Quebec style poutine. You will be dissapointed. Not even sure the cheese was curd. If it ain't curd, it ain't poutine!\",\n",
       " \"After a night of reveling and beer consumption on 17th Ave, my friends and I decided to sample some of The Big Cheese's poutines... Kudos to the Big Cheese for staying open late on the weekend.\\n\\nI love poutine: It would be my last meal if I was about to die.... But it wouldn't be a Big Cheese poutine. Although the Big Cheese has a great selection of unique toppings and combinations (i.e. carolina pulled pork, sausage, sour cream, beef), their fries aren't anything special and their gravy is extremely bland. I had bites of the Notorious P.I.G., Hogzilla and Veggie Nacho. All of them had bland gravy, over-cooked meat and stale fries.\\n\\nFor a bigger serving, a lower price and a more traditional Quebecoise poutine, Alberta King of Subs is worth the drive to the NE. For a unique, gourmet-type poutine, try Brava Bistro's lobster poutine.\",\n",
       " \"My Wife & I stepped into the Big Cheese for a quick meal while between errands. Both being Vegans, we were pleased to see the door menu advertised Vegan options. We both opted for the traditional poutine, vegan style. The poutines were ready quick, and were tasty. We were in & out in no time, and would likely come back. Now I'm no poutine connoisseur - I understand there's a specific true Quebec way to make this speciality, but I have no real idea how close these are to what some consider a true poutine, but to a layman, it was a fine meal. The Pros were the kind staff, the quick meal, the fact that they can do a vegan option, and that is was ready quick & was tasty. The decor was also decent. The cons were that the place was quite small & cramped, and while the vegan options were there, I believe it cost me an extra $1.50 for the vegan cheese - and by no means am I against charging extra for a speciality product with a short shelf life, but it meant that one small vegan poutine came to over $7.00. Overall though, we had a good experience.\",\n",
       " 'Walked past this place a lot and never really had a hankering for poutine. So I waited until the right day for the salty fatty treat.\\n\\nThe environment was pretty cool I\\'ll admit and there were a handful of people dining inside. Didn\\'t have a single problem with the customer service, which is a huge thing for me. And the music was great. I went with the Montreal Smoked Meat. I took note of the guy making poutine in the back but found it too awkward to watch after a while so I just kind of stared at the wall which had interesting details until my food was ready.\\n\\nThe poutine came with a very lovely grainy mustard and a pickle. The Meat was all right, and there was a lot. What I didn\\'t expect based on the name, was that there would be more meat then cheese curds. I\\'m not sure if they all melted or what but they were hardly in there. I guess it\\'s expensive to have \"authentic cheese curds\" in your poutine in Calgary. Another thing I noticed was that the gravy was liquid, which I did not like at all and that without the mustard I would not have enjoyed my food.  I didn\\'t mind that some of my fries were really soft, and some were crunchy. \\n\\nOh and the \"big\" cheese didn\\'t have that squeak that curd connoisseur\\'s crave. \\n\\nOverall I was satisfied, but I went into the place with no expectations, other then a sign that constantly reminded me about where I can get some poutine.',\n",
       " \"They have quite the extensive menu , all poutine based. This was my first time having this treat in Canada itself. We had the peppercorn chicken, a small. Now if splitting, the small is just a snack size for two. If you're hungry j recommend getting your own. There wasn't much chicken in our poutine, so I was a little disappointed in that sense. Overall poutine is a decent dish. The environment here is pretty chill, casual, laid back. Nice place to stop in for a snack!\",\n",
       " \"Ordered the veggie poutine. It was awful. Fries were cold and soggy! Won't come back.\",\n",
       " \"Just went to the Big Cheese for a post-drinking snack (yes, on a Monday).\\nThe man wanted the Philly Cheese Steak poutine so we shared a large.

It was delicious.  However, the reasons I can only give it a three stars are because:\\n- Really, how hard is it to make a poutine.  It is almost impossible to mess it up, no?\\n- And the presentation of the poutine is quite un-appetizing.  Mind you, the poutine IS delicious, but if you just look into the box.....just not attractive nor appetizing at all.  \\n\\nThe three stars really belongs to:\\n- Their fries are good.  No doubt.  Just eating the fries alone, I would be happy.\\n- Their gravy is good.  Not too thick, not too watery.  It is just right.\\n- The novelty.  I love the idea that they have variety of selections for the poutines.\",\n",

They are very generous with their portions, they load up on the curd cheese (which is vital) and don't cheap out on the gravy, or whatever sauce is on your poutine. I think that their prices are highly reasonable, $8 for a box of deliciousness (then again I've paid $15 for a poutine once). \\n\\nThe staff is friendly, quite knowledgable on their poutine and that is important. The place is small but there's loads to do along 17th so why not just take it to go? \\n\\nI recommend the chicken Scottish Curry for all you wondering what it would taste like ...

I had the chicken peppercorn poutine. The fries weren't bad: not great but not terrible like I've heard in the past. Chicken and cheese curds were yummy. However, I could not stomach the peppercorn sauce - not sure what about it but I am all about the traditional gravy, apparently. So much so that I could only finish about 1/4 of it before giving up. \\n\\nSo, while my first visit wasn't amazing, I will be back to try again as it's not totally their fault that my choice was bad.

We ordered the pull pork with bacon and sausage poutine aka Notorious P.I.G.  I thought it would taste spectacular since they specialize in just poutines, but quite frankly new York fries is probable better.  The only difference is they have a wide range of toppings such as AAA beef, chicken, pork and a few more ordinary mix-ups that you wouldn't normally add to your fries.  They use a typical beef gravy, much like something that you could whip up at home yourself.  The poutine left a sour after taste, my friend suspected that it was red wine.  I was curious to find out what it was so I asked the cashier.  I brought the poutine up to the counter and saw the look on her face, she was probably hoping that I wouldn't complain. She said the sour after taste came from the south western sauce marinaded with the pork.  \\n$8 for a small poutine is a tad high but it's loaded with meat so I guess it's worth it if you're a meat lover.\\nThe place is small and cozy so it's perfect for a small snack on a cold day, not so much a hot day because it was rather warm so I couldn't imagine how stuffy it would be on a hot day. \\nThis shack would definitely curb your enthusiasm if you're a poutine lover, not so much for me.\",\n",

Ok, so...yum! She, by the way, was chatting and friendly and wonderful.\\n\\nThe fries were perfectly cooked (namely, well, but a little bit gravy-logged, which I like), the cheese was a little meltier than I would have liked, but blame that on it being take-away and there's not much to do about the encased poutine in the ten minutes it took to get back to the office.\\n\\nAll of the Porky goodness was great. There was a hint of a-little-too-strong vinegar that probably comes from the pulled pork, but wasn't so strong as to adversely affect the overall flavour.\\n\\nI'll be more than pleased to head back to Big Cheese and sample some of their many, many other poutines! Most likely to be most often at somewhere around 2:00 am. (Forgot to ask how late they're planning to be open. I'd think they'd do late night. I'd HOPE they'd do late night!)\",\n",

Granted, they had opened just after a Poutine Crawl event that I had been on the day before, so at least for me they were up against some pretty serious competition. I found that their fries were a bit undercooked, but I quite enjoyed the different toppings that they had. Initial rating was, in my mind, 3 stars.\\n\\nRound 2 - I was there after a friend's birthday party. It seems they fixed their issue with the fries being undercooked, but overall the poutine toppings tasted absolutely horrible. Their peppercorn sauce tasted quite bad, and the toppings were sub-par. Keeping in mind that I was drunk (and I've been known to eat pretty much anything when it comes to late-night hungries), I was quite surprised at how bad it tasted. This rating would have been 1.\\n\\nLikelihood of going back? Pretty low, especially since there are other excellent places in Calgary to get a good poutine.\",\n",

I understand they have to refrigerate them here (unlike Quebec & Ottawa) so you won\\'t get the full squeak, but these were still below par even for Alberta\\n2) 2 of the 3 times I ate there, some of the fries were overdone to the point of being rock hard.

       " \"Being a former Montrealer, I've been raised on poutine during my teen to adult years.  You need the right type of squeaky cheese.  The fries have to be fried twice. The sauce has to be brown and rich.\\nWell... they got the cheese right.  And they do have some pretty imaginative combinations that does make the poutines there interesting.  But the base of it all, is still the sauce and the fries.  And I can say, they've completely messed that up (and CBC reviewer John Gilchrist completely agrees with me when he did his own review in 2011).  \\nLook, the fries are done twice for a special reason.  The first time locks in the flavour.  The second helps enhance the crispness despite the gravy soaking in.  And at even the most basic places in Montreal, such as the legendary Lafleur hot dog and fries chain in Montreal, this is always done with FRESH potatoes cut right there on the spot.  I walk in, and what do I see?  Bags of McCain's-like frozen fries bags being opened and then cooked once.  \\nThen came the sauce.  Basically, it was lifeless, with little real taste except maybe too much salt.  Back home, the poutine gravy is made with some sort of beef base, and has a great flavour on it's own.  Hell, some people I know even drink it straight with their meals.  This was just a sauce that wasn't too far from powdered mix.  \\nAs Mr. Gilchrist said, and I whole heartedly agree, if you're going to make yourself the gourmet poutine place to go in Calgary, then follow the basic steps at least.  If you need inspiration, go to Canmore and try the poutine at LA BELLE PATATE, a poutine easily matching some of the best Quebec has to offer.  Just make it right people!\",\n",
