https://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-to-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript,"5868        Using regular expressions is probably the best way. You can see a bunch of tests here (taken from chromium)function validateEmail(email) {    const re = /^(([^<>()[].,;:s@""]+(.[^<>()[].,;:s@""]+)*)|("".+""))@(([[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z-0-9]+.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;    return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());}Here's the example of regular expresion that accepts unicode:const re = /^(([^<>()[].,;:s@""]+(.[^<>()[].,;:s@""]+)*)|("".+""))@(([^<>()[].,;:s@""]+.)+[^<>()[].,;:s@""]{2,})$/i;But keep in mind that one should not rely only upon JavaScript validation. JavaScript can easily be disabled. This should be validated on the server side as well.Here's an example of the above in action:function validateEmail(email) {  const re = /^(([^<>()[].,;:s@""]+(.[^<>()[].,;:s@""]+)*)|("".+""))@(([[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z-0-9]+.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;  return re.test(email);}function validate() {  const $result = $(""#result"");  const email = $(""#email"").val();  $result.text("""");  if (validateEmail(email)) {    $result.text(email + "" is valid :)"");    $result.css(""color"", ""green"");  } else {    $result.text(email + "" is not valid :("");    $result.css(""color"", ""red"");  }  return false;}$(""#email"").on(""input"", validate);<script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js""></script><label for=email>Enter an email address:</label><input id=""email""><h2 id=""result""></h2>ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Jul 16 at 22:56            community wiki                25 revs, 23 users 35%rnevius8654This regex eliminates valid, in-use emails.

Some simple cases it doesn't match a@b@c.com, a(b)@c.com. See the RFC for more. Here's a regex that won't reject any valid addresses [^@]+@[^@]+.[^@]+ and protects against common errors.–VrooOct 26 '12 at 6:32190You cannot validate email addresses, period. The only one who can validate an email address is the provider of the email address. For example, this answer says these email addresses: %2@gmail.com, ""%2""@gmail.com, ""a..b""@gmail.com, ""a_b""@gmail.com, _@gmail.com, 1@gmail.com , 1_example@something.gmail.com are all valid, but Gmail will never allow any of these email addresses. You should do this by accepting the email address and sending an email message to that email address, with a code/link the user must visit to confirm validity.–Kevin FeganFeb 1 '14 at 8:492@KevinFegan let's be realistic: you would not be using JavaScript to confirm whether an e-mail is authentic. I see this validation as perfectly reasonable when a user signs up. You probably do not want to bother sending verification e-mails to addresses that cannot possibly exist. Some might also have outbound e-mail limits, making it north worth it to send e-mails to email@localhost, i don't have an email or any other funny user inputs.–undefinedJul 16 at 23:02gautam+@Gmail.com - showing is valid which should not–Gautam ParmarAug 6 at 6:33|Show 3 more comments            1076        I've slightly modified Jaymon's answer for people who want really simple validation in the form of:anystring@anystring.anystringThe regular expression:/S+@S+.S+/To prevent matching multiple @ signs:/^[^s@]+@[^s@]+.[^s@]+$/Example JavaScript function:function validateEmail(email)     {        var re = /S+@S+.S+/;        return re.test(email);    }    console.log(validateEmail('anystring@anystring.anystring'));ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Jul 29 at 15:50            community wiki                9 revs, 9 users 37%C.

Depending on your application it may be more likely to come across  someone will get mad because you don't accept their unconventional email, rather than someone who causes problems by entering email addresses that don't really exist (which they can do anyways by entering a 100% valid RFC2822 email address but using an unregistered username or domain). Upvoted!–user83358Jul 30 '12 at 18:20116@ImmortalFirefly, the regex you provided will actually match name@again@example.com. Try pasting your line into a JavaScript console. I believe your intention was to match only the entire text, which would require the beginning of text '^' and end of text '$' operators. The one I'm using is /^[^s@]+@[^s@]+.[^s@]+$/.test('name@again@example.com')–OregonTrailAug 9 '12 at 14:58The second regexp does not require a top-level domain, i.e. it accepts user@domain. But AFAIK this is actually a valid e-mail address, although uncommon. The first regexp requires a TLD, so it doesn't cover these types of addresses.–waldgeistJul 15 at 13:00Add a comment|            850        Just for completeness, here you have another RFC 2822 compliant regexThe official standard is known as RFC 2822. It describes the syntax that valid email addresses must adhere to. You can (but you shouldn't — read on) implement it with this regular expression:(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|""(?:[x01-x08x0bx0cx0e-x1fx21x23-x5bx5d-x7f]|[x01-x09x0bx0cx0e-x7f])*"")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?).){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[x01-x08x0bx0cx0e-x1fx21-x5ax53-x7f]|[x01-x09x0bx0cx0e-x7f])+)])(...) We get a more practical implementation of RFC 2822 if we omit the syntax using double quotes and square brackets. It will still match 99.99% of all email addresses in actual use today.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?A further change you could make is to allow any two-letter country code top level domain, and only specific generic top level domains. This regex filters dummy email addresses like asdf@adsf.adsf. You will need to update it as new top-level domains are added.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?.)+(?:[A-Z]{2}|com|org|net|gov|mil|biz|info|mobi|name|aero|jobs|museum)bSo even when following official standards, there are still trade-offs to be made. Don't blindly copy regular expressions from online libraries or discussion forums. Always test them on your own data and with your own applications.Emphasis mineShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Jun 20 '20 at 9:12            community wiki                7 revs, 5 users 83%voyager294NB: ""In actual use today"" may have been valid when the code was written, back in 200x.

Once you have come to terms with that, there are many implementations out there that can get you halfway there, this article sums them up nicely.In short, however, the only way to be absolutely, positively sure that what the user entered is in fact an email is to actually send an email and see what happens.

An email address is name_part@domain_part and practically anything, including an @, is valid in the name_part; The address foo@bar@machine.subdomain.example.museum is legal, although it must be escaped as foo@bar@machine..... Once the email reaches the domain e.g. 'example.com' that domain can route the mail ""locally"" so ""strange"" usernames and hostnames can exist.–Stephen PMar 7 '13 at 1:40Add a comment|            248        HTML5 itself has email validation. If your browser supports HTML5 then you can use the following code.<form>  <input type=""email"" placeholder=""me@example.com"" required>  <input type=""submit""></form>jsFiddle linkFrom the HTML5 spec:A valid e-mail address is a string that matches the email production of the following ABNF, the character set for which is Unicode.email   = 1*( atext / ""."" ) ""@"" label *( ""."" label )label   = let-dig [ [ ldh-str ] let-dig ]  ; limited to a length of 63 characters by RFC 1034 section 3.5atext   = < as defined in RFC 5322 section 3.2.3 >let-dig = < as defined in RFC 1034 section 3.5 >ldh-str = < as defined in RFC 1034 section 3.5 >This requirement is a willful violation of RFC 5322, which defines a syntax for e-mail addresses that is simultaneously too strict (before the ""@"" character), too vague (after the ""@"" character), and too lax (allowing comments, whitespace characters, and quoted strings in manners unfamiliar to most users) to be of practical use here.The following JavaScript- and Perl-compatible regular expression is an implementation of the above definition./^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$/ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited 19 hours ago            community wiki                8 revs, 6 users 33%Anoop136this is good, but the problem with this is that it must be inside a form tag and submitted by a submit input, which not everyone has the luxury of doing.

An article with the best solution I've found in PHP is What is a valid email address?. Obviously, it has been ported to Java. I think the function is too complex to be ported and used in JavaScript. JavaScript/node.js port: https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-addresses.A good practice is to validate your data on the client, but double-check the validation on the server. With this in mind, you can simply check whether a string looks like a valid email address on the client and perform the strict check on the server.Here's the JavaScript function I use to check if a string looks like a valid mail address:function looksLikeMail(str) {    var lastAtPos = str.lastIndexOf('@');    var lastDotPos = str.lastIndexOf('.');    return (lastAtPos < lastDotPos && lastAtPos > 0 && str.indexOf('@@') == -1 && lastDotPos > 2 && (str.length - lastDotPos) > 2);}Explanation:lastAtPos < lastDotPos: Last @ should be before last . since @ cannot be part of server name (as far as I know).lastAtPos > 0: There should be something (the email username) before the last @.str.indexOf('@@') == -1: There should be no @@ in the address. Even if @ appears as the last character in email username, it has to be quoted so "" would be between that @ and the last @ in the address.lastDotPos > 2: There should be at least three characters before the last dot, for example a@b.com.(str.length - lastDotPos) > 2: There should be enough characters after the last dot to form a two-character domain. I'm not sure if the brackets are necessary.ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Oct 31 '18 at 9:15            community wiki                5 revs, 4 users 82%Miloš Rašić0Add a comment|            71        All email addresses contain an 'at' (i.e. @) symbol.

NOBODY DOES THIS EVER! It's obsolete. But, it IS included in the true RFC 2822 standard and omitted here.Note 2:The beginning of an email (before the @ sign) can be case sensitive (via the spec). However, anyone with a case-sensitive email is probably used to having issues, and, in practice, case insensitive is a safe assumption.

It's too complicated and would not cover all the cases.Now since you can only cover 90% of the cases, write something like:function isPossiblyValidEmail(txt) {   return txt.length > 5 && txt.indexOf('@')>0;}You can refine it. For instance, 'aaa@' is valid. But overall you get the gist. And don't get carried away... A simple 90% solution is better than 100% solution that does not work.

The only real way to get it correct would be to send a test email to the account. That said, there are a few basic checks that can help make sure that you're getting something reasonable.Some things to improve:Instead of new RegExp, just try writing the regexp out like this:if (reg.test(/@/))Second, check to make sure that a period comes after the @ sign, and make sure that there are characters between the @s and periods.

I think Regex is only good for a rudimentary validation. It seems that the checking validation of email addresses is actually two separate problems:1- Validation of email format: Making sure if the email complies with the format and pattern of emails in RFC 5322 and if the TLD actually exists. A list of all valid TLDs can be found here.For example, although the address example@example.ccc will pass the regex, it is not a valid email, because ccc is not a top-level domain by IANA.2- Making sure the email actually exists: For doing this, the only option is to send the users an email.ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Jul 2 '18 at 1:47            community wiki                2 revsbmanAdd a comment|            14        Use this code inside your validator function:var emailID = document.forms[""formName""][""form element id""].value;atpos = emailID.indexOf(""@"");dotpos = emailID.lastIndexOf(""."");if (atpos < 1 || ( dotpos - atpos < 2 )){    alert(""Please enter correct email ID"")    return false;}Else you can use jQuery.

The literal ""Type"" is the base type, and the brackets mean this is the array type of that base. Array types are in turn types of their own, which allows you to make multidimensional arrays like Type[][] (the array type of Type[]). The keyword new says to allocate memory for the new array.  The number between the bracket says how large the new array will be and how much memory to allocate. For instance, if Java knows that the base type Type takes 32 bytes, and you want an array of size 5, it needs to internally allocate 32 * 5 = 160 bytes.You can also create arrays with the values already there, such asint[] name = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};which not only creates the empty space but fills it with those values. Java can tell that the primitives are integers and that there are 5 of them, so the size of the array can be determined implicitly.ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Oct 12 '13 at 9:45Ryan70277 silver badges2121 bronze badges        answered Jul 29 '09 at 14:29ChetChet19.2k1010 gold badges3636 silver badges5757 bronze badges1So it is not necessary to include int[] name = new int[5] ?–Cookie MonsterJun 28 '18 at 10:26Add a comment|            30        The following shows the declaration of an array, but the array is not initialized: int[] myIntArray = new int[3];The following shows the declaration as well as initialization of the array:int[] myIntArray = {1,2,3};Now, the following also shows the declaration as well as initialization of the array:int[] myIntArray = new int[]{1,2,3};But this third one shows the property of anonymous array-object creation which is pointed by a reference variable ""myIntArray"", so if we write just ""new int[]{1,2,3};"" then this is how anonymous array-object can be created.If we just write:int[] myIntArray;this is not declaration of array, but the following statement makes the above declaration complete:myIntArray=new int[3];ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Jun 22 '14 at 21:57Peter Mortensen28.9k2121 gold badges9696 silver badges123123 bronze badges        answered Jun 4 '13 at 6:02Amit BhandariAmit Bhandari50166 silver badges88 bronze badges33There is absolutely no difference between the second and third approaches, other than that the second approach only works when you're also declaring a variable.

There are several ways to declare and int array:int[] i = new int[capacity];int[] i = new int[] {value1, value2, value3, etc};int[] i = {value1, value2, value3, etc};where in all of these, you can use int i[] instead of int[] i.With reflection, you can use (Type[]) Array.newInstance(Type.class, capacity);Note that in method parameters, ... indicates variable arguments. Essentially, any number of parameters is fine. It's easier to explain with code:public static void varargs(int fixed1, String fixed2, int... varargs) {...}...varargs(0, """", 100); // fixed1 = 0, fixed2 = """", varargs = {100}varargs(0, """", 100, 200); // fixed1 = 0, fixed2 = """", varargs = {100, 200};Inside the method, varargs is treated as a normal int[]. Type... can only be used in method parameters, so int... i = new int[] {} will not compile.Note that when passing an int[] to a method (or any other Type[]), you cannot use the third way. In the statement int[] i = *{a, b, c, d, etc}*, the compiler assumes that the {...} means an int[]. But that is because you are declaring a variable. When passing an array to a method, the declaration must either be new Type[capacity] or new Type[] {...}.Multidimensional ArraysMultidimensional arrays are much harder to deal with. Essentially, a 2D array is an array of arrays. int[][] means an array of int[]s. The key is that if an int[][] is declared as int[x][y], the maximum index is i[x-1][y-1]. Essentially, a rectangular int[3][5] is:[0, 0] [1, 0] [2, 0][0, 1] [1, 1] [2, 1][0, 2] [1, 2] [2, 2][0, 3] [1, 3] [2, 3][0, 4] [1, 4] [2, 4]ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited May 23 '15 at 20:09Unheilig15.8k193193 gold badges6565 silver badges9696 bronze badges        answered May 23 '15 at 19:56hyper-neutrinohyper-neutrino4,61522 gold badges2222 silver badges4545 bronze badgesAdd a comment|            11        In Java 9Using different IntStream.iterate and IntStream.takeWhile methods:int[] a = IntStream.iterate(10, x -> x <= 100, x -> x + 10).toArray();Out: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]int[] b = IntStream.iterate(0, x -> x + 1).takeWhile(x -> x < 10).toArray();Out: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]In Java 10Using the Local Variable Type Inference:var letters = new String[]{""A"", ""B"", ""C""};ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited May 22 '19 at 22:22        answered Feb 21 '18 at 12:45Oleksandr PyrohovOleksandr Pyrohov13.4k55 gold badges5454 silver badges8686 bronze badges0Add a comment|            10        If you want to create arrays using reflections then you can do like this: int size = 3; int[] intArray = (int[]) Array.newInstance(int.class, size ); ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited May 23 '15 at 20:08Unheilig15.8k193193 gold badges6565 silver badges9696 bronze badges        answered Jan 20 '15 at 11:54Muhammad SulemanMuhammad Suleman2,75622 gold badges2323 silver badges3333 bronze badges1Why would you want to create an array that way?–Dorian GrayJan 8 '20 at 19:38Add a comment|            10        In Java 8 you can use something like this.String[] strs = IntStream.range(0, 15)  // 15 is the size    .mapToObj(i -> Integer.toString(i))    .toArray(String[]::new);ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Jan 2 at 1:59Peter Mortensen28.9k2121 gold badges9696 silver badges123123 bronze badges        answered Mar 8 '18 at 18:21Chamly IdunilChamly Idunil1,56811 gold badge1212 silver badges2727 bronze badgesAdd a comment|            9        Declaring an array of object references:class Animal {}class Horse extends Animal {    public static void main(String[] args) {        /*         * Array of Animal can hold Animal and Horse (all subtypes of Animal allowed)         */        Animal[] a1 = new Animal[10];        a1[0] = new Animal();        a1[1] = new Horse();        /*         * Array of Animal can hold Animal and Horse and all subtype of Horse         */        Animal[] a2 = new Horse[10];        a2[0] = new Animal();        a2[1] = new Horse();        /*         * Array of Horse can hold only Horse and its subtype (if any) and not           allowed supertype of Horse nor other subtype of Animal.         */        Horse[] h1 = new Horse[10];        h1[0] = new Animal(); // Not allowed        h1[1] = new Horse();        /*         * This can not be declared.         */        Horse[] h2 = new Animal[10]; // Not allowed    }}ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Jun 25 '16 at 21:59Peter Mortensen28.9k2121 gold badges9696 silver badges123123 bronze badges        answered Oct 16 '15 at 10:18278718427871843,38188 gold badges3939 silver badges7272 bronze badgesAdd a comment|            8        Array is a sequential list of itemsint item = value;int [] one_dimensional_array = { value, value, value, .., value };int [][] two_dimensional_array ={  { value, value, value, .. value },  { value, value, value, .. value },    ..     ..     ..        ..  { value, value, value, .. value }};If it's an object, then it's the same conceptObject item = new Object();Object [] one_dimensional_array = { new Object(), new Object(), .. new Object() };Object [][] two_dimensional_array ={  { new Object(), new Object(), .. new Object() },  { new Object(), new Object(), .. new Object() },    ..            ..               ..  { new Object(), new Object(), .. new Object() }};In case of objects, you need to either assign it to null to initialize them using new Type(..), classes like String and Integer are special cases that will be handled as followingString [] a = { ""hello"", ""world"" };// is equivalent toString [] a = { new String({'h','e','l','l','o'}), new String({'w','o','r','l','d'}) };Integer [] b = { 1234, 5678 };// is equivalent toInteger [] b = { new Integer(1234), new Integer(5678) };In general you can create arrays that's M dimensionalint [][]..[] array =//  ^ M times [] brackets    {{..{//  ^ M times { bracket//            this is array[0][0]..[0]//                         ^ M times [0]    }}..}//  ^ M times } bracket;It's worthy to note that creating an M dimensional array is expensive in terms of Space.

I am adding a few tricky ways to create arrays (from an exam point of view it's good to know this)Declare and define an arrayint intArray[] = new int[3];This will create an array of length 3. As it holds a primitive type, int, all values are set to 0 by default. For example,intArray[2]; // Will return 0Using box brackets [] before the variable nameint[] intArray = new int[3];intArray[0] = 1;  // Array content is now {1, 0, 0}Initialise and provide data to the arrayint[] intArray = new int[]{1, 2, 3};This time there isn't any need to mention the size in the box bracket. Even a simple variant of this is:int[] intArray = {1, 2, 3, 4};An array of length 0int[] intArray = new int[0];int length = intArray.length; // Will return length 0Similar for multi-dimensional arraysint intArray[][] = new int[2][3];// This will create an array of length 2 and//each element contains another array of length 3.// { {0,0,0},{0,0,0} }int lenght1 = intArray.length; // Will return 2int length2 = intArray[0].length; // Will return 3Using box brackets before the variable:    int[][] intArray = new int[2][3];It's absolutely fine if you put one box bracket at the end:    int[] intArray [] = new int[2][4];    int[] intArray[][] = new int[2][3][4]Some examples    int [] intArray [] = new int[][] {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}};    int [] intArray1 [] = new int[][] {new int[] {1,2,3}, new int [] {4,5,6}};    int [] intArray2 [] = new int[][] {new int[] {1,2,3},{4,5,6}}    // All the 3 arrays assignments are valid    // Array looks like {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}It's not mandatory that each inner element is of the same size.    int [][] intArray = new int[2][];    intArray[0] = {1,2,3};    intArray[1] = {4,5};    //array looks like {{1,2,3},{4,5}}    int[][] intArray = new int[][2] ; // This won't compile. Keep this in mind.You have to make sure if you are using the above syntax, that the forward direction you have to specify the values in box brackets. Else it won't compile. Some examples:    int [][][] intArray = new int[1][][];    int [][][] intArray = new int[1][2][];    int [][][] intArray = new int[1][2][3];Another important feature is covariant    Number[] numArray = {1,2,3,4};   // java.lang.Number    numArray[0] = new Float(1.5f);   // java.lang.Float    numArray[1] = new Integer(1);    // java.lang.Integer   // You can store a subclass object in an array that is declared   // to be of the type of its superclass.   // Here 'Number' is the superclass for both Float and Integer.

You can do it in the following way:a)int[] a = new int[5];orb)int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};so the basic pattern is for initialization and declaration by method a) is:datatype[] arrayname = new datatype[requiredarraysize];datatype should be in lower case.So the basic pattern is for initialization and declaration by method a is:If it's a string array:String[] a = {""as"", ""asd"", ""ssd""};If it's a character array:char[] a = {'a', 's', 'w'};For float double, the format of array will be same as integer.For example:double[] a = {1.2, 1.3, 12.3};but when you declare and initialize the array by ""method a"" you will have to enter the values manually or by loop or something.But when you do it by ""method b"" you will not have to enter the values manually.ShareImprove this answer                Follow            edited Sep 7 '19 at 17:17Peter Mortensen28.9k2121 gold badges9696 silver badges123123 bronze badges        answered Aug 4 '19 at 12:06Syed Salman HassanSyed Salman Hassan3833 bronze badgesAdd a comment|"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/global-warming-1-5-degrees-celsius-climate-change-2219436,"PARIS: Half a degree Celsius may not seem like much, but climate experts say a world that has warmed 1.5 degrees Celsius above 19th-century levels compared to 2 degrees Celsius could be the difference between life and death.A 2degrees Celsius Earth would see the number of people facing extreme heat waves more than double. A quarter of a billion more people would face water shortages.The Arctic Ocean will be ice-free not once in a century but once every 10 years.Countries that signed the Paris Agreement vowed to cap the rise in global temperatures - already 1.1degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial benchmark -at well below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably at 1.5 degrees Celsius.Humanity is still far off the mark: Even if fulfilled, current pledges to reduce emissions would still set the planet on course to warm by a ""catastrophic"" 2.7 degrees Celsius, according to the UN.Here is what the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says we can expect in a world that warms by 1.5 degrees Celsius, 2degrees Celsius and beyond.HEAT WAVESMaximum temperatures in some areas will increase by three degrees if the climate warms 1.5 degrees Celsius, four if global heating reaches the 2degrees Celsius-mark.Heat waves that occur once-a-decade today will become four times more likely at 1.5 degrees Celsius, and nearly six times more likely at 2 degrees Celsius.The odds of extreme hot spells currently seen once every 50 year increase by nearly nine fold at 1.5 degrees Celsius, and 40 fold in a 4degrees Celsius-world.More people will be affected as well: The percentage of humanity exposed to extreme heatwaves at least once every five years jumps from 14 per cent at 1.5degrees Celsius to 37 per cent with an extra half-a-degree.STORMSGlobal warming will cause more rain at higher latitudes, north and south of the equator, as well as in the tropics and some monsoon zones.Precipitation in sub-tropical zones will likely become rarer, raising the spectre of drought.Extreme precipitation events today are 1.3 times more likely and seven per cent more intense than before global warming kicked in.At 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, extreme rain, snowfall or other precipitation events will be 10 per cent heavier and 1.5 times more likely.DROUGHTIn drought-prone regions dry spells are twice as likely in a 1.5degrees Celsius world, and four times more likely if temperatures climb 4 degrees Celsius.Capping the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5degrees Celsius rather than 2degrees Celsius would prevent an additional 200 to 250 million people from facing severe water shortages.Limiting drought would also reduce the risk of related disasters such as wildfires.FOODIn a world that is two degrees warmer than pre-industrial levels, seven to 10 per cent of agricultural land will no longer be farmable.Yields are also predicted to decrease, with corn harvests in tropical zones estimated to drop by three percent in a 1.5degrees Celsius warmer world and seven percent with a rise of 2 degrees Celsius.SEA LEVELSIf global warming is capped at 2 degrees Celsius, the ocean watermark will go up about half a metre over the 21st century. It will continue rising to nearly two metres by 2300 -twice the amount predicted by the IPCC in 2019.Because of uncertainty over ice sheets, scientists cannot rule out a total rise of two metres by 2100 in a worst-case emissions scenario.Limiting warming to 1.5degrees Celsius would reduce rising sea levels by 10 about centimetres.SPECIES IN PERILAll these impacts affect the survival of plants and animals across the planet.Global warming capped at 1.5degrees Celsius negatively affects seven percent of ecosystems. At 2 degrees Celsius, that figure nearly doubles.An increase of 4degrees Celsius would endanger half of the species on Earth."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/living/how-make-dalgona-candy-squid-game-2224831,"First, it was dalgona coffee (remember those ""circuit breaker"" days?). Now, thanks to the hit South Korean drama Squid Game, it’s dalgona candy. Immortalised as the high-stakes children’s game in the third episode, the brittle honeycomb thins were given out to the participants in the show, who had to pick shapes out of their dalgona sweets with needles. Break the shape and there were no sweet endings for them. In real life, those who succeed in picking out the shapes get rewarded with another wafer-thin honeycomb by the vendor. And since the little game involves using a toothpick, the sweet is also known as ppopgi, meaning to pick. These sweets are traditionally sold as street food in South Korea, much like how biscuit piring (yup, those wafer-thin treats in yellow, pink and green) is sold at our pasar malam. (Maybe someone should start a game with that.)Naturally, kits for making dalgona candyhave been flying off online shopping portals and can range from less than S$5 to S$28. But it is a recipe consisting of just white sugar (the kind you add to coffee) and a pinch of baking soda. It is so simple that Chef Cat of@thatlittlepuff on Instagram is also in on the game.        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by That Little Puff (@thatlittlepuff) As for the tools, you can find them in your kitchen. Here’s what you need to make each dalgona candy:Two tablespoons of sugarA pinch of baking sodaThe smallest, non-stick pan you haveA pair of chopsticks (preferably wood or other materials that don’t melt)Glass jar with flat bottomCookie cutter of your preferred shapeA sheet of baking paper1. Turn the stove on and use the lowest flame; you don’t want to burn the sugar.2. Place the sugar in the non-stick pan and heat it. Tilt the pan at an angle (and keep it there) so that the sugar pools in a small area instead of spreading out over the pan.3. Stir with the chopsticks and keep stirring as the sugar melts. Let the melted sugar turn a milk coffee colour (the darker the colour, the more bitter it becomes). You can adjust the heat by lifting the pan or bringing it back to the fire. 4. Once all the sugar has melted, remove the pan from the fire. Immediately add a pinch of baking soda and stir constantly. The mixture’s colour will lighten. Make sure all the baking soda dissolves and there are no lumps. 5. Pour the mixture onto the baking paper. Wait for about 10 seconds, then place the jar on the mixture and gently press it down to flatten it. Don’t press too hard because you still want to retain some thickness for the cookie cutter. 6. Remove the jar and quickly press down with the cookie cutter. Let it cool and harden. You’re now ready to play Squid Game. Minus the part where you get killed."
