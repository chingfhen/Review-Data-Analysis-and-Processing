      "The reason I am giving the Original Pancake House a 3 star rating is because of it is location and competition  Not only is it right next door to Denny is say what you will about their food but it is right down the road from Gab N Eat and Barb is The difficult parking lot that is always full would definitely sway me to pick Gab N Eat or Barb is especially if I was not in the mood for pancakes\n",
      "I have been a few times now and the food is always really good The service is very nice but a little slow I believe our waitress took advantage of the fact that we were younger chill customers and chose to ignore us during a very busy time because of it We waited 30 minutes before she came back to our table for our check But she was a very kind women and I understand the struggle of a rush on a Saturday morning so I will not hold it against her I will go again\n",

      "I was not crazy about the corned beef hash But I do recommend the coconut pancakes which come with an awesome tropical glaze I got a taste of Darren is Crabcakes Benedict and they were scrumptious The service was great our server was adorable and talkative and overall they serve good breakfasts here \n",

      "Definitely worth eating  Pancake House\n",
      "If you can find a spot in the lot then give it a try The building is pretty neat and the prices are reasonable I had an omelet with American cheese it was a Friday in Lent so I can not speak for the meat they make each omlete with 6 or maybe even 8 eggs and it fills up the whole plate It was excellent as was the fruit salad I was not feeling the love from the pancakes or the coffee however The coffee was extremely strong so that is fine if you like it that way but I do not There was not really anything wrong with the pancakes they just were not anything to write home about they had a bit of a burnt taste Because of the omelets however I would probably pick this place over a Denny is or something \n",
      "\n",
      "Word to the wise map this place before you come We came from McKeesport and went through all of the South Hills and it ended up taking us about an hour and fifteen minutes to get there However it ended up being maybe a mile from the Greentree Rd exit on the Parkway West so we could have been there in 35 minutes had we taken that route\n",
      "Always prompt service hot coffee and great food I just wish they served pumpkin pancakes year round Although the superpulpy orange juice is not my favorite\n",
      "food is good service is crappy and the parking is horrible at the green tree location wont return their again\n",
      "This place is amazing The bacon was crispy the pancakes were good honestly the experience is great I would recommend the Dutch baby it is an interesting bowl shaped pancake with thicker dough that has lemon powdered sugar and butter on the side that can be placed on it It has such a good taste I would most definitely recommend it\n",
      "After recieving a dirty coffee cup  the owner manager gave me defense attitudelike it was my faultwhen my food dropped there was a long and big piece of hair in my Dutch babyagain they asked if I want another I am thinking No I like foreign hair in my foodat the end my family finished before I even had my food and I would assume they would want to at the very least pay for my horrible breakfastThe Answer was No And we do not care if your a decent customer who comes in a lotwe do not care if you come backto the owner or person who called themselves an owneryou suck as a restaraunteur\n",
      "We go here sometimes when we do not feel like going far The food is ALWAYS good and there is enough of it to make you full\n",
      "This time around we had a coupon to use so we made use out of it We got two nice filling entrees for a quick meal I got a spinach omelette with three pancakes and my husband got an egg entree with three pancakes We will be back \n",
      "Note OPH is parking lot is perilously hard to get into particularly on weekends I advise you to go there late in the morning or early in the afternoon during the week We tried to visit at least twice before only to leave in frustration because we could not find a parking spot\n",
      "\n",
      "With that word of guidance I can candidly say that The Original Pancake House was worth the effort Kay and I each had an unplanned day off last week and we knew this would likely be our best chance to go Arriving at around 11AM we were at first dismayed to find the lot full yet again after traveling that winding mountainous nearly endless road to what comes off as a shining castle in the sky but before we could even think of turning back a silverhaired gent in an equally cinereal luxury car began to pull out With glee we took that vacated space entered the restaurant and were seated with no wait whatsoever  \n",
      "\n",
      "Kay and I were welcomed by a greying urbane sociable modish and towering fellow I will refer to as The Brunchman He was elated that we finally made it and seemed to be precognitive we felt he knew us despite never having met him \n",
      "\n",
      "You have come to us at last he declared as he gracefully skirred towards an empty and clean table with Kay and I in pursuit\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as we sat down our young lanky bespectacled server appeared before us seemingly instantaneously Her name was I think Nicole and she is not only an aspiring model but also previously hailed from Kay is general area In Nicole we both made a new friend discussing concerts food and life with her as we indulged on delecacies from OPH is expansive bill of fare\n",
      "\n",
      "When I saw that the strawberries came with fresh whipped cream I knew what my first course would be considering my obsession with said dairy product The strawberries themselves were ripe and pure In a separate bowl came an alabaster cloud of felicity and through the cloud were the strawberries dredged making for simple natural pleasures of the palate\n",
      "\n",
      "A Crabcake Eggs Benedict came next and with that my lone complaint Hollandaise Sauce is a tricky thing to master I have tried to make it myself with somewhat mixed results In this case it simply tasted like warmed over unseasoned egg yolks However the eggs were poached expertly the duo of crabcakes were crammed with genuine crustacean meat the buttery English muffins were plush and the pink remoulade the dish is saving grace was such a wedding of tangy and creamy that the bland Hollandaise sauce was easily overpowered and forgotten\n",
      "\n",
      "Psst Brunchman My mom will sell you her Hollandaise recipe \n",
      "\n",
      "Kay had the Coconut Pancakes which were as crispy as they were fluffy and came with exquisitely airy whipped butter as well as an edibly esoteric hot tropical syrup that evoked sheer Paradise with its fruity sugariness Also eaten by Kay was an order of Corned Beef Hash I found the large chunky auroral potatoes to be flawless and the plentiful corned beef to be as keenly kosher and arcanely flavorful as any I have ever had but Kay did not like it as much as I did sadly enough Thankfully her pancakes made her happy\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter The Dutch Baby My mother had spoken of it in whispers when telling me of her experience with the North Hills OPH Since it takes 20 minutes to prepare it is recommended that one order it with the rest of brunch \n",
      "\n",
      "Minutes before it was placed in front of me The Brunchman dramatically gave me a consultation \n",
      "\n",
      "With his eyes ablaze and his long arms oscillating as if he was about to cast a spell he said Take the butter spread itAROUND the interior of theerrrbaby Then squeeze some lemon onto it and dust it with the powdered sugar After his lecture he kissed his fingers and floated away asking rhetorically with a beam across his lips You will be back tomorrow morning no \n",
      "\n",
      "When it was ready for service I followed The Brunchman is instructions closely The Dutch Baby is not a pancake it is a bowl of doughy love made lardy by the butter lightly sweet by the powdered sugar and acidic by the lemon However something was amiss Syrup I drizzled some onto the puff and Nicole leaped forward to stop me only to be held back gently by the grinning Brunchman He pressed a finger to her lips shook his head and looked my way only to nod in approval \n",
      "\n",
      "I was hoping you would do that The Brunchman said I forgot to mention the syrup You did well young man \n",
      "\n",
      "The syrup would be what took this puddinglike dish also known as a Bismarck into Shangrila \n",
      "\n",
      "As I finished The Brunchman provided a history lesson and Nicole spoke with us some more this time about her cosmetology goals and former places of employment Kay and I were so taken by the OPH is hospitality we almost forgot that we were not at someone is home and had other plans for the day Although our hunger had been abated we felt compelled to stayand return\n",
      "Unmatched experience for customer service and flavor Seriously above any other pancake spot in Pittsburgh\n",
      "The staff was very friendly and inviting The French toast was delightful and my friend said that the bacon pancakes were awesome\n",
      "Food is generally good breakfast food Service runs very hot and cold Hostess is not effective Dull normal If their service improved would be a great breakfast place\n",
      "On our way out since the nearest Pamelas was closed due the Labor Day Holiday we drove here I ordered the kielbasa and pancake platter and it was really good The coffee was terrible though and the waiter had add as we had to keep repeating what we wanted\n",
      "To the Polly d look alike fuck you the best way to not get a tip is to make sure to make your customer wait for 30 min for drinks\n",
      "I have been here multiple times with friends and family and I have loved everything I have had  I have had the buttermilk pancakes chocolate chip pancakes pumpkin pancakes Swedish pancakes and a blueberry blintz  The bacon and sausage are delicious you can tell it is of good quality  They use real maple syrup and cream  The prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality\n",
      "I would say that the food was good but nothing special The menu is really extensive with a lot of pancake crepe French toast and waffle options from the griddle If you are in the mood for savory food they also have a lot of options with eggs omelets and the whole 9 yards for breakfast They also have a lunch menu but I did not look at that The service was really not that great but it was not the worst I have had either I would probably go back though\n",
      "Being a traveler and compared to the other major cities that I have been in the breakfast was actually very well priced for the quality  I love how their menu allows you to build your own plate to some degree since many items are broken out individually  I went in midweek and was quickly seated  However most importantlythe bacon quality is really really outstanding\n",
      "Just as we sat down a young male waiter yelled at the hostess and made a scene RIGHT IN FRONT OF US that we were sat in his section she herself ended up taking care of us and I am glad she did However I totally understand there is a system we were one of three people sat in the section and he was waiting on one party of the three I get this is a chain and for what it is worth it is good breakfast food My finicky boyfriend was very pleased with his eggs Benedict   I will go back as long as that guy is not my waiter I had view of kitchen and saw his attitude through out the whole time It was dissapointing I work in the food industry and understand situations and attitude there is no excuse for his behavior at least take it away from view of your customer\n",
      "I usually get the well done potato pancakes  with maple syrup and butter and a side of bacon\n",
      "For starters the restaurant is incredibly large so do not be afraid to bring a group My husband and I have never once had slow or bad service All of the staff really help each other out and are sure to make your dining experience a good one It is nice when you are at breakfast and your coffee does not get cold bc they are always quick to refill it The dress is casual I have tried and LOVED the spinach eggs Benedict the blueberry pancakes the breakfast crepes and the corned beef hash I hope you enjoy this place as much as we do\n",
      "Went to this place for the first time last weekend Went at about 11 am and there was about a 20minute waitnot too bad The menu is overwhelmingly huge but luckily we had already picked out what we wanted while we were waiting for our table\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not a big fan of sweet type of food for breakfast which is a shame because they had some amazingsounding options so I got the kielbasa scrambler and it was VERY good Good portion good price and very tasty \n",
      "\n",
      "Boyfriend got the Dutch baby There is a little bit of an extra wait for that but it is worth it It was amazing He ate every bite Apparently it is their classic dish \n",

      "The place is decorated kind of fancylike But the customers around us seemed kind ofsnooty or something I do not know It seemed like a very conservative kind of place where you might go with the family after church Which is fine because it is all about the food but this is not somewhere I would go and feel totally comfortable personally\n",
      "I went to TOPH on a late Sunday morning with a fairly large group We had to wait about 3040 minutes to be seated though it was all worth it when we got our food If you do decide to eat here I recommend the pancakes hence the name I was amazed at all of the unique pancakes I ended up sticking with the traditional buttermilk pancakes which were fluffy buttery and melted in your mouth My friend got the s amores however which was adorned with mini marshmallows chocolate syrup and turned out to be equally delicious The wait for the food was also a little long however our waitress was very kind and friendly and kept checking in on us and refilling our drinks The interior is nice not very special and easy on the eyes It was a little loud however I loved it and can not wait to go back\n",
      "This place was a great find Had to wait a little as it was busy for Sunday breakfast but once we were sat it was worth the wait The staff was incredibly friendly and prompt The food was delicious and the portions were a large size Our group got pancakes both regular and blueberry and they were good The omelettes were the size of the plates and extremely filling Crab cake eggs benedict were also a hit All and all worth the wait and would return at any time\n",
      "One of the best breakfasts spots around You will never leave here hungry huge portions Lots of great pancakes and omelettes to choose from Good coffee and service in this large restaurant Sometimes a small wait for tables and difficulty parking due to the popularity of the place\n",
      "I stood in the entrance way for six minutes and not one employee came over  Finally someone came over and asked if I wanted to be seated I said yes and was promptly seated at smallest table next to kitchen entrance   I pointed to a different table and the man hrumphed as he walked me over  I turned around and stated sorry I bothered you I am going to Denny is and I left\n",
      "I have been there four times and have had a really good breakfast each time  I love the coconut pancakes and their homemade whipped cream  My kids love the Rainbow and Reese is pancakes  I have not tried the omelets yet but they are huge and look great  If you like breakfast then you need to give this place a try  Oh the coffee is pretty good too\n",
      "Definitely go here if you love pancakes They have some great combinations and the portions are enormous I am not huge on breakfast sweets but I still very much enjoyed my Swedish pancakes and I thought it was cool to try something different besides your typical chocolate chip or blueberry hotcakes We were in and out of there pretty quickly but we did go late on a weekday morning so I am not sure what the wait is like during peak hours I really enjoyed their coffee as well and the restaurant was cozy and I imagine would be perfect on a chilly winter morning for breakfast\n",
      "We stumbled on this restaurant when we were planning on going to Dennys Going to the pancake house was the best decision we made that day We have been back a few times since and we will be back\n",
      "Unfortunately we will no longer be going to the Pancake House This morning we went for breakfast My husband wanted to order a few things a la Carte as they did not have exactly what he wanted Our section was about half full and it was not super busy The waitress charged us for 3 meals rather than 1 meal and the a la Carte items We pointed out the math to her and she said she would be right back She never came back She waited on other tables and ignored us 20 minutes later when she came back she handed us a new check Or what we thought was a corrected check \n",
      "\n",
      "When we got to the register it was the exactly same check after she told us she would adjust it At the register we asked to speak to the manager and we waited for another 20 minutes but no manager appeared We had spent enough time waiting at the Pancake House  We were tired of waiting and ended up paying and leaving At that point we just wanted to go home Customer service seems like a very low priority We were really disappointed with this experience\n",
      "Hearty food quick friendly service reasonable prices Solid breakfast joint\n",
      "Yummy but overpriced for a chain I like the cherry pancakes Their homemade whip cream is really good I did not like their ordinary link sausage latte or corned beef hash Stick to their specialty the cakes\n",
      "The building itself seems to be renovated from an old house awesome atmosphere The staff was friendly and our waiter was great Food was outstanding we got the blueberry pancakes and an apple cinnamon waffle Both were light and fluffy nothing was too sweet Both dishes featured real fruit the pancakes came with extra blueberry sauce and the waffle with warm apple syrup Portions are generous without being overbearing at least for the short stack The best part though real maple syrup\n",
      "Decent service and environment horrible cook Omelette was atrociously overcooked and would not have been served by anyone who knows what one is supposed to look like Bacon was also ridiculously overcooked and resembled beef jerky more than anything in consistency and color Previous experiences here were great but this one was pathetic Overall a massive disappointment\n",
      "I had breakfast there 618 14  I had a omelet which was very dry and undercooked The service was poor My waitress was giving me my check before my food ever came I asked for extra butter when i did get my meal and waitress never brought it The environment \n",
      "Is nice but food and service was below par Very overrated\n",
      "I love love this place Now it is a little on the expensive side but it is well worth it The last time I was there I had the almond french toast Absolutely amazing\n",

      "If you are hungry get an omelet They come in four egg or six egg It is a breakfast fit for a King  Yes five stars for a breakfast place is odd but it is always that good  Even the coffee is fantastic\n",

      "The place is huge inside and pretty but it comes with a price PH is expensive\n",
      "I did not have high hopes for the Original Pancake House but I was pleasantly surprised  The bacon pancakes were spectacular and I loved the thick crisp slices of bacon  Be prepared to wait on weekends however\n",
      "I love this spot as a goto breakfast spot The Original Pancake house has a great menu for a price that is comparable to what I consider to be lower quality diners Denny is and Eat n Park Why not go to the Original Pancake house if you have a choice between the two \n",
      "There is plenty of setting in gigantic booths I think the interior is furnished with Amish made fixtures If they are not Amish they still give you a quality feel The booths are huge and eating in this place definitively will not leave you feeling desperate for your space to enjoy the time and meal there\n",
      "I have eaten there many times I am a huge fan of the weekday specials which are dirt cheap for such great combos Most of the time I find myself there on a weekend though when the specials are not offered It is then I really have to start choosing what I am gonna satisfy myself with that morning Pancakes are a no brainer but all you get is pancakes unless you pay for a side of something else That is the advantage of the weekday specials your choice of eggs meat and pancakes regular or special for a low price I have had so many of the special pancakes I can not decide which is my favorite I can not say I have ever been disappointed though I did get a crazy stomach ache one day trying to finish a full stack Beware It is a lot of pancakes The omelets are also great Again on the weekends you are limited to a 6 eggs omelet VS the weekday when you can get a smaller size 6 eggs is a huge omelet My favorite here is clear thoughthe Greek omelet is amazing Stuffed with lamb spinach and that delicious cucumber sauce Wow what a great meal\n",
      "One of my only complaints is about the orange juice They only offer one kind I think it is fresh squeezed on site I am all about fresh squeezed but there must be something about the oranges they use or maybe I just do not like pulp but it is never what I am looking for The coffee however is great and you will not have any trouble taking down several cups of that\n",
      "When you are ready to go remember you have to pay up front near the exit Do not sit at the table with your card out waiting for the waitress to take it for you She probably will say something because all the staff has been friendly and accommodating in my experience but you can save yourself some minutes just knowing ahead of time We you do leave you can look over the hill to the Denny is below and feel good about yourself that you made the better choice \n",
      "This place is awesome  The only downside is that next time I am going to have to remember to not eat for 3 days prior to arrival as the servings are HUGE  The staff was very friendly the place is clean and nicely decorated and the prices are very reasonable considering how much food you get\n",
      "\n",
      "They had a special the day we were there of deep fried bananna nut bread and I now truly believe that anything can be deep fried and made into a delicious eating event  Lots of tables and space and even the wait when crowded was no more than 30 minutes\n",

      "I can not say the same for my husband is blueberry waffles  Rather than have the blueberries cooked in the waffle batter they were thrown atop of  a waffle  While this may not have been a problem if the blueberries were fresh they were not they were frozen or in the least bit sweet they were not and barely edible my husband took off all the blueberries and ate them without it  I get that it is not blueberry season so there may be an issue with getting fresh blueberries but tossing inedible still coldpartially frozen blueberries on to an otherwise decent waffle makes it worse  \n",

      "\n",
      "The cakes were hot off the griddle steaming and just a little undercooked in the middle which added to their tenderness The syrup added the sweetness needed and complimented the  the buckwheat pancakes to a tee Did I detect a touch of cinnamon in the syrup or was it in the batter Who cares it was delicious The coffee was nothing special even though  the menu exclaims it is award winning and they sell if on premises for home brewing \n",

      "The place is overly noisy no acoustic absorbing ceiling tiles to keep the customer is conversations from bouncing off the walls For convenience at the bottom of the bill they give a gratuity calculation or 18 or 20 Way better than Eat N Park Denny is and King is my only issue is the parking lot smallish and way undersized for a restaurant this size Avoid this place on a Sunday morning as I am sure it is packed to the rafters My bill was 856 for three cakes and endless coffee\n",
      "This place should be called the best place on earth to eat delicious pancakes that will make your stomach crave more and more I enjoyed just about everything here It has a very simple elegance to the interior Not over done and almost too plain but somehow it works \n",

      "Nothing crazy good Food is kind of bland Orange juice is great though The crepes are better than the pancakes in my opinion I have had the German potato pancakes smores pancakes and a few different crepe dishes The Dor Stop restaurant in Dormont has better pancakes\n",

      "Food was good but pricey Gave you large portions enough to share Restroom was disgusting\n",
      "After a recent group breakfast here I can not imagine returning  We did have a large group but not so large that it would explain the poor service  We had to flag the waiter down for coffee refills  even then he ignored several empty cups  One of our group had made a specific request regarding a serious food allergy  when the food came out wrong her polite request for a replacement was met with 2 managers visiting our table to try to convince her to accept the order as it was prepared  What conscientious restaurant employee would knowingly risk an allergic reaction for a patron  There are far too many great choices in the South Hills  I will not return  I did like their custom pottery mugs\n",

      "Not bad but nothing special The omelets had a weird aftertaste Not a place I would seek out again\n",
      "They seem to pack you in when you have a large party This is a problem since your order is multiple plates DO NOT order the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict  there is far too much cheap fillers in their crake cakes I did not care for having to pay as you head out the door maybe since our table was near the register and the lines at times crowded our table I found nothing to make me come back Our waitress seemed to run past the table avoiding eye contact and was poor on checking back\n",

      "Simply elegant for a pancake house The place sits atop a hill and is decorated and maintained beautifully We love the original pancake house and it is unfortunate there is not one closer than 2 hours from our home While we were in Pittsburgh we were lucky enough to find this place close to where we stayed The food coffee and decor are great  The freshly squeezed OJ is fantastic from what I was able to enjoy  My one year old Isabella decided she liked it too and frank most of it  This place will not disappoint This gem in Pittsburgh is simply great It is a must  Enjoy\n",
      "I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast or brunch The food is wonderful and they have a large variety of pancakes to choose from blueberry is my favorite and they have many other great breakfast items including omelets that are HUGE  delicious They have sandwiches and lunch items as well The prices are fair and the food is fresh One negative is parking which is very limited but I would highly recommend this restaurant for a great meal\n",
      "Not only are the breakfast dishes the best and the restaurant the most attractive comfortable and spacious of its kind but this is the place for the perfect Jewishstyle reuben sandwich as good as any delicatessen I have visited throughout the United States  The seeded rye bread kosher corned beef cheese and dressing made the dish delectable and the home fries included for the reasonable price of 999 made for a perfect early lunch Service from Corinne was cheerful friendly and quick  Our three dishes were out in less than ten minutes Bravo Mr Schweinsberg and staff  You are the best\n",

      "\n",
      "My boyfriend of course ordered the famous Apple Pancake which we were told takes at least 30 minutes to prepare which he was fine with It is worth the wait people It basically tasted like a huge the size of a frisbee apple cinnamon roll that with a gooey syrupy sometimes crunchy coating of pure caramelized sugar deliciousness It is extremely rich  I would recommend sharing this with at least one other person because it is huge  very very sweet\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the Italian omelette w a fruit cup The omelette was just huge The egg was fluffy and the sliced hot sausage inside was soft and yummy but the sauce tasted very bland and just thrown on top I also did not care for the sharp shredded cheese on top I think mozzarella would fit better Mostly there was just way too much egg to get an even bite of everything I would not recommend this omelette\n",

      "Great service and excellent food what else could you ask for  Got here with my family in the midst of the lunch rush  We were in a bit of a hurry but even with a line they had us at a table in less than 5 minutes  The menu is extensive sandwiches crepes sweet and savory pancakes of course and so much more  It was really hard for me to choose just one item because everything sounded so delicious  I finally decided on the cherry crepes which were superb The crepes were tender and delicate the cherry sauce was wonderful and not cloying sweet  I would definitely eat here again\n",
      "It was hard to find parking on Sundays The atmosphere is really nice but noisy It reminds me of the waffle house but more elegant You have to wait to be seated which took around 15 mins After we sat the waiter did not come for like 5 mins When she came we were ready to order We had to wait around 30 mins for our food The food was good but I was disappointed in some of the dishes such as the fruit crepe The crepe was soggy and salty Service is OK The waiter did not come to check on us until we were done eating The prices are reasonable\n",
